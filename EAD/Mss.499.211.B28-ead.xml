            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">An expert in tropical botany, Harley Harris Bartlett (1886-1960) spent the majority of career in the Department of Botany and Botanical Gardens at the University of Michigan. He traveled widely in tropical Asia and the Americas collecting plants and looking for sources for rubber. While employed by the U.S. Rubber Company to collect in Asahan, in northeastern Sumatra in 1918 and 1927, Bartlett learned the Batak language and made ethnographic, ethnobotanical, and linguistic observations that became the basis for a number of articles. 
                <lb/>The Bartlett Batak Collection consists of over 600 bamboo "sticks" collected by Bartlett in 1918 and 1927. Written by informants at Bartlett's request, the bamboo sections are inscribed in Batak, an Austronesian language written in a phonetic alphabet. They include traditional writing- and reading-manuals, short poems, letters, and magical formulae and incantations.</abstract>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>An expert in tropical botany with wide-ranging interests, Harley Harris Bartlett was born at Anaconda, Montana, on March 9, 1886. After studying chemistry at Harvard (A.B., 1908), Bartlett accepted a position as a chemical biologist with the Bureau of Plant Industry, working on the genetics of 
                <emph render="italic">Oenothera</emph>, and although he left government employment only a few years later, he often took part in government sponsored projects seeking to exploit the resources of tropical forests.</p>
            <p>In 1915, Bartlett moved to the faculty at the University of Michigan, eventually becoming full professor (1921), head of the Botany Department (1922-1947) and Director of the Botanical Garden (1919-1955). He traveled widely during his years in Ann Arbor, collecting plants from tropical regions in Asia and the Americas. His most ambitious schemes included two trips to Asahan, in northeast Sumatra in 1918 and 1927, when he explored for the U.S. Rubber Company. During the Second World War, he worked in the Office of Rubber Investigations of the Department of Agriculture, exploring for sources for rubber in Central and South America. Bartlett collected elsewhere in the Caribbean and Asia, and spent the academic year 1934-1935 as an exchange professor at the University of the Philippines.</p>
            <p>Bartlett's travels and wide-ranging interests led to publications in a number of disparate fields. When he was awarded the Merit Award of the Botanical Society of America at his retirement in 1956, he was cited "for his unflagging support and encouragement of the whole field of botany and its students and for his diverse contributions to paleobotany, enthnobotany, ecology, and systematics." His stay in Sumatra produced articles on Batak and Malay ethnography and linguistics, and he wrote works in history and ethnohistory, as well. In 1929 Bartlett was elected to the APS. Bartlett remained in Ann Arbor after his retirement, where he died of heart failure on February 21, 1960.</p>
