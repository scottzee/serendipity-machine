There are three notebooks filled with student lecture notes from the years 1913-1914. Also, a collection of articles Bazzoni wrote while teaching at Pennsylvania, including several memos to the Educational Survey Committee. There is a notebook tracking his experiments while in London at King's College, and copies of two dissertations by students, presumably from the years Bazzoni was at Pennsylvania. Materials from the post-Pennsylvania years is limited to a notebook of Potential Center Displacement of Logger Tests.</abstract>

            <p>Charles Blizard Bazzoni was born in Newburgh, New York, on January 28, 1886. In 1911, he received a B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, and continued to study and teach there, until 1914, when he earned his Ph.D. in Physics. After a brief excursion to teach physics at King's College London, Bazzoni returned to Pennsylvania in the position of Associate and then Full Professor of Experimental Physics from 1919-1938. Ultimately, he chose to leave academia to serve as the Chief Geophysicist for the Sun Oil Company. He was an accomplished author with several books to his credit, including The Kernels of the Universe, (1927), and Energy and Matter, (1937). His research interests focused on extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy, ionization and resonance potentials, and high frequency radiation in well loggers. Bazzoni died in June of 1970.</p>
