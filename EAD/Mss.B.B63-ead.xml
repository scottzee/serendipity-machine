            <p>The Bohlen Collection contains one item which may be of interest to naval historians:</p>
            <p>
                <ref target="ref27">Perry, Oliver Hazard</ref>. Letter to Daniel Murray. 1818 March 1. "In reply to your inquiry respecting the affair which has...lately made so much noise, and which has brought upon me such a torrent of abuse and malignant calumny -- I shall only briefly state that [the circumstances as related] are all false with the exception of my having given personal chastisement to an impertinent and insolent fellow, -- who is destitute of truth and spirit -- and who has been base enough to circulate the most unfounded slander, and then deny it under his own hand." 1 item.</p>

            <head>Early American History Note</head>
            <p>John Bohlen was a prominent Philadelphia merchant in the nineteenth century, dying a millionaire. Bohlen, a Hollander, established a firm with his brother that specialized in trade with his native country. His greatest success came in the lucrative gin trade. As his business increased, so too did his connections. He served on the Board of the first Bank of the United States and was well-connected with highest the political and business leaders in the nation. Although John Bohlen was a prominent and successful businessman, these documents have little bearing on Bohlen himself. Instead, they are a series of letters (ten total) written by prominent Americans either to Bohlen or to his relatives.</p>
            <p>The collection seems to have been passed down through the family. Although the content rarely sheds much life on the Bohlenâ€™s life or career, the letters offer some hint into the social circles that Bohlen operated within. Letters from Meriwether Lewis, Stephen Girard, and the Bank of the United States to Bohlen touch on financial matters. Other letters are often notes of acknowledgement or an exchange of pleasantries. The letter from Francis Scott Key to Daniel Murray discusses a sermon and includes an extract from it.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The Bohlen Collection contains a scant ten letters that appear to have been retained, as much as anything, for their autograph interest. Although they shed relatively little light on the life of John Bohlen, they do offer interesting glimpses into the personalities of Bohlen's famous correspondents. Five letters were received by Bohlen, three letters by his relative by marriage, Daniel Murray, and one each by other relatives, Elizabeth Dorsey and John Gregg.</p>
            <p>Among the interesting items in the collection is a fine letter written by Meriwether Lewis in Saint Louis, 1808, regarding collecting debts owed to Bohlen, a letter of Timothy Pickering to Elizabeth Dorsey displaying his eloquent and gracious style, waxing over his visit to her home, and a prototypical Oliver Hazard Perry letter fulminating about calumnies made against him. The three page letter of Francis Scott Key is also interesting in that it includes two pages of excerpts from a sermon that impressed Key.</p>
            <p>Also included in the collection are a letter apprising Bohlen of his appointment as Director of the Bank of the U.S., and two letters of one of Bohlen's relatives pertaining to an early (1850s and 1860s) interest in collecting the autographs of famous Americans and mentioning the discovery of an account book of George Washington's secreted in a wall at West Point.</p>
