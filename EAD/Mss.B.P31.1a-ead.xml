            <p>The Charles Wilson Account book for 1785-1795 contains an assortment of business transcations of C.W. Peale during this period, most of which deal with his museum. In addition to the business accounts – which are sparse but may contain noteworthy information on Peale’s personal interests – this volume contains a series of watercolors and pencil sketches, likely done by Peale. They are relatively crude sketches of a dog, houses, profiles of unknown individuals, flowers, and other items.</p>
