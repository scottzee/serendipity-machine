            <p>This collection contains information on the prominent Philadelphian Fox family with a large portion of the collection focusing on the family’s land holdings and business dealings. George Fox was a close friend of William Temple Franklin, who bequeathed to Fox his grandfather’s papers. George Fox was a doctor educated at the University of Pennsylvania. His brother Samuel was a businessman. Samuel’s son Charles became a doctor. The collection reflects various papers relating to the lives and careers of these three men.</p>
            <p>Most of the loose papers deal with lands that George and Samuel Fox owned or managed for others and are legal in nature. The Fox family’s land dealings brought them into contact and sometimes partnership with many prominent individuals, such as Henry Lee, James Wilson and the Cadwalader and Hockley families. There are extensive account and receipt books from the 1780s, 1790s, and early nineteenth century. There is some personal correspondence as well, but the majority is related to land dealings.</p>
            <p>The other miscellaneous papers are bound volumes that include a written guide on proper manners, recipes, tickets for medical lectures, Samuel Fox’s oath of allegiance from 1777, a commonplace/account book of Samuel Fox, and a journal of a European tour in 1785, probably of George Fox.</p>
            <p>This collection is noteworthy for surveys of Western Pennsylvania drawn between the 1790s and the 1830s. The collection also contains a late nineteenth century photograph album of historic houses, nature scenes, California, and property the Fox family owned called Chesnutwood on the outskirts of Philadelphia near Andalusia.</p>
