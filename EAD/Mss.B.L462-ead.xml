            <head>Early American History Note</head>
            <p>Isaac Lea was a Philadelphia based geologist and publisher. He was primarily a publisher, founding the firm Lea and Febiger, which had its origins in Matthew Carey’s publishing house. Isaac married Carey’s daughter Frances Anne in 1821. Always interested in science, in 1851, after retiring from the day-to-day operations of his printing firm, he dedicated his time to geology and other scientific interests. This collection contains the journals of Isaac Lea’s trips to Europe in 1832 and 1852-53. Lea traveled to Europe to become acquainted with European ideas and methods, although both trips – especially the earlier one – included much sightseeing. Very much a gentleman scientist, Lea gained wide-respect for his knowledge and work, earning an honorary doctorate from Harvard. These travel journals provide insight into some of the people and practices he encountered in Europe that may have shaped his ideas about science.</p>
            <p>The journals are not just – or even primarily – scientific. The numerous journals also chronicle his personal journeys and observations about European culture and cities. Lea was an astute cultural observer and his prose is not only engaging but also insightful. He also made a number of landscape sketches in these journals.</p>
            <p>Also part of the collection is an account of George Washington consulting with Lea’s ancestors near Brandywine during the War for American Independence. Related to this account is a well-written travel account of Isaac Lea’s family visiting the site of the battle in 1849 and other places in the Chadds Ford area.</p>
            <p>Some genealogical information is included as well.</p>
            <p>The journals are all photocopies of the originals, which are in private hands.</p>
