            <head>Early American History Not</head>
            <p>Charles Willson Peale’s diaries offer a remarkable window into the world of early America. Peale kept diaries from 1760 until his death. There are twenty-six discreet volumes. Peale’s entries are often very detailed and content rich. Peale’s life spanned a remarkable number of events. He was very active in the American Revolution, which is chronicled here, and his continued work as an artist and innovator in early America is well-recorded here, as are the smaller anecdotes of life, like social outings and family affairs. There are also many sketches scattered throughout the volumes. The diaries not only provide insight into Peale’s own life but often record events happening within Philadelphia and beyond.</p>
