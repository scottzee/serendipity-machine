            <p>Rubens Peale managed his father Charles Wilson Peale's museum in Philadelphia from 1810 to 1822. At that time, he bought his brother Rembrandt's controlling interest in the Peale Museum in Baltimore, He also opened branches in New York City and in Utica, New York. He eventually sold his collection to P.T. Barnum. In 1840, he settled on a farm in Pottsville, where he farmed and painted still-life.</p>
