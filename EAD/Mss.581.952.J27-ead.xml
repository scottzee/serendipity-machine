            <p>Prior to October 1865, George Tyson collected 300 exquisitely detailed watercolors of Japanese plants painted by local artists in Nagasaki and assembled them into the present volume. Each watercolor is identified by name and month of blooming, some with brief additional descriptive notes. An index at the front of the volume provides transliterations of the Japanese names.</p>
            <p>In the letter of donation that accompanied the gift of the Tyson volume, the donor, William Morris Davis, wrote:</p>
            <p/>
            <p>You will observe that, while the foliage and leaves are given in a free off hand manner, with good effect, The flowers are in many instances given with a minuteness of detail truly microscopic, in fact the wonderful delicacy of execution, of the work can only be appreciated by examining it with a lens of high magnifying power."</p>
