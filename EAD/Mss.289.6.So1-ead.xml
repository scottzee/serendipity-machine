            <p>In October 1719, the Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends for Philadelphia and the Jersies reached consensus on a "book of discipline" governing the "establishment and order of meetings." The regulations covered both the conduct of the Quarterly and Monthly Meetings and the personal comportment of individual members, refining the bureaucratic structure of the meetings and laying out the powers of Overseers and other officials. It touches upon marriage (mandating endogamy), burial, and attendance at meetings, and cautions Friends to plainness of speech and dress, drinking, smoking, backbiting, and gaming.</p>
            <p>Among other rules, the Book of Discipline proscribed selling alcohol to Indians, "it being contrary to the care Friends have always had since the settlement of the Countries, that they might not contribute to the abuse and hurt those poor people receive by drinking thereof" and selling Indian slaves, and banned "the fetching or importing Negroe Slaves from their own Country or elsewhere," cautioning owners of slaves to be humane in their treatment.</p>
