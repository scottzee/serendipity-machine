            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">Trained as an anthropologist under Frank Speck at the University of Pennsylvania, the ethnohistorian George Snyderman (1908- ) spent his career studying Seneca Indian religion, history, and culture. Snyderman edited the previously unpublished diaries of Halliday Jackson and John Phillips, Quaker missionaries to the Senecas in the late 18th and early 19th century. 
                <lb/>The Snyderman Papers includes a small volume of correspondence, along with manuscripts of works by Snyderman and colleagues, and copies of primary source materials pertaining to Seneca history. Of particular interest is his correspondence with anthropologists William N. Fenton, Merle Deardorff, and Frank Speck and with his Seneca consultant Clara Redeye and her daughter, Helen Harris, and photographs of the Allegany Senecas taken by Fenton and Speck.</abstract>

All photographs have been removed from Series I-IV and placed in Series V. Cross-references appear in the original series. Reprints have been moved to the printed materials collection of the APS Library. If a reprint was found as an enclosure, a photocopy of the title page was filed in its place. To retrieve reprints, consult the card catalog for printed materials. Audio-cassette recordings, three of Seneca music and one of Clara Redeye, have also been removed from the collection; to retrieve those items, consult the card catalog for manuscript materials.</p>

                    <p>Incoming with comparatively little outgoing correspondence. The largest series in the collection, Series I is arranged alphabetically by correspondent's name and then chronologically within each folder. Unidentified correspondence has been filed as "Unidentified" and is arranged chronologically. Enclosed manuscripts have been removed from this series and placed in Series III or IV as appropriate. As with the reprints, a photocopy of the title page was filed with the original letter.</p>
                    <p>Correspondents include anthropologists, government officials, students, Native Americans, and interested amateur anthropologists. Among the topics covered in this series are Iroquois ceremonies and customs and the business of the Pennsylvania State Employment Service. There are many letters from Clara Redeye, whom Snyderman met while doing fieldwork, and who, with her husband Sherman, adopted Snyderman in a Seneca ceremony in 1947. Also included are letters from Clara Redeye's daughter, Helen Harris. Both womens' letters detail daily life, social customs, and folklore of the Seneca of Allegany Reservation. Correspondence with Merle H. Deardorff and William N. Fenton documents the exchange of information on the Iroquois; Deardorff's correspondence also includes information about the construction of Kinzua Dam. Letters from Marcus Solomon Goldstein discuss various topics, including anthropology and life in Israel.</p>

                    <p>Native American Images note : Removed from the Series I-IV, over one hundred black and white silver gelatin prints, postcards, and color Polaroid of the Allegany Senecas and St. Lawrence Mohawks of New York. Taken by William N. Fenton, Frank Speck, and Snyderman, the images include Cold Spring longhouses, corn husk false faces, and Iroquois masked medicine dancers. The oversize maps in Series II and III, hand-drawn, crayon-colored by Snyderman, reflect nineteenth century Native American settlements in Iowa, Missouri, and Ohio. Of interest, Speck’s student Jane Willets’ Ottawan Chief Ettawageshik, Snyderman’s Seneca consultant Helen Harris, and Ray Fadden’s Akwesasne Mohawk Council print materials. Images date from 1939-1993; Maps from 1795-1866.</p>
