            <p>These two volumes called Charles Willson Peale’s “memorandum books” are much more like commonplace books from the era. They contain a range of entries dealing with a variety of topics. Entries include information on medical cures, on making cements and different types of paints, and various other topics. The bulk are related to the mechanics of art, however.</p>
