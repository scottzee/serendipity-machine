            <p>Born in Königsberg, Prussia, on October 9, 1714, the Moravian missionary Johann Jacob Schmick studied theology as a young man and became acquainted with the teachings of the United Brethren as early as 1742, taking his first communion six years later. He was called to become a missionary in 1751, and was appointed to the Indian congregation at Gnadenhutten, Pa., ministering primarily to a congregation of Mahican converts who had settled there. Schmick taught reading and writing, and was particularly known for teaching singing and introducing the spinet and other instruments to the Indians.</p>
            <p>After the original settlement at Gnadenhutten was attacked and destroyed in 1755, Schmick remained with the Mahicans through exile and captivity, facing almost constant threats from white neighbors. He joined his congregation as they sought refuge in Bethlehem, followed them as captives to Philadelphia, and remained with them after they settled in Wyalusing (also called Friedenshutten), Pa., in 1765. Schmick's last move with his congregation came in 1773, when he moved to the new settlement of Gnadenhutten in the Ohio Valley. He was not present at the Gnadenhutten massacre, having returned to Lititz, Pa., in 1777. He died there on Jan. 23, 1778.</p>
