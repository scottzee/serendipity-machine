            <p>This humorous piece of advice and instruction for newly arrived Palatines was written "By their Countryman H I Z a Freeholder in the Province." It contains various recommendations and references to individuals with thinly veiled names, such as "If you want a quack that sets up for a skillful Physician send for Dr. K____y." The concluding line recommends to "Drink hard, Laugh loud, + run deeply in Debt" for those who desire to possess a "perfect calmness of Thought, to sleep sound &amp; enjoy a good measure of Health."</p>

            <head>Early American History Note</head>
            <p>This short piece offers a satirical take on some Philadelphians. Framed as a list of advice for new German immigrants, the piece has a more political tone in which it offers a critical appraisal of some prominent members of society and business. These two pages are in Benjamin Franklinâ€™s hand. Once thought to a work of Franklin's, since 1963, it has been believed that Franklin was not the original author of this piece.</p>
