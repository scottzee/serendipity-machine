            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">Nathanael Greene was one of the leading commanders in the Continental Army, and the only officer George Washington saw as capable of leading in his absence. Greene served as a field commander, member of Washington's staff, Quartermaster General, and commander of the Army in the Southern Theater. Greene was born on July 27, 1742 in Potowomut, Rhode Island to a Quaker family, who believed that their children would learn more from manual labor then from attending school. Lacking a formal education Greene was very intelligent and taught himself to read, developing early on a love of books - particularly military history and theory. It was through reading, not experience, where Greene learned his knowledge of military science. Between 1778 and 1780 he reluctantly served as Quartermaster General, and was able to drastically improve supplying the Continental Army. Greene ended his military career leading the American Southern army to victory over the British. Greene died in Georgia in June 1786. 
                <lb/>The Papers of Nathanael Greene come from Greene's tenure as Quartermaster General of the Continental Army between 1778 and 1780. The collection primarily consists of Greene's correspondence with officers in the quartermaster department, officers in the Army (including George Washington), and members of the Continental Congress; relating to the operation of the Quartermaster Department with requests for supplies, forage, and money. In addition, there is also correspondence between officers of the Quartermaster Department. The content of the letters provide a detailed account of the logistical obstacles that Greene and his subordinates faced in trying to keep not only the Quartermaster Department but the Continental Army running. The papers do not contain any material relating to Greene's military service or private life either before or after his tenure as quartermaster general.</abstract>

            <p>The Nathanael Greene Collection is a large collection of correspondence primarily related to supplying the Continental Army. The bulk of the correspondence dates from 1778-1780, during which time Greene served as Quartermaster General of the Continental Army. The correspondence captures the supply issues that the Army faced during the war, and the means of financing and supplying it. Because the bulk of the collection is correspondence and not account or ledger books, the letters to Greene from the field often provide interesting details and anecdotes on requisitioning.</p>
            <p>Because Greene was tasked with supplying the entirety of the Continental troops, the correspondence includes reports on military operations throughout the United States. There are some reports on various military court proceedings, often involving those tasked with supply. Of particular note is an extensive collection on John Bancker’s court of inquiry, who had served as barrack master for the supply depot at Fishkill before he was replaced because of incompetence.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The Papers of Nathanael Greene are 4 linear feet in size and come from Greene's tenure as Quartermaster General of the Continental Army between 1778 and 1780. The collection consists primarily of Greene's correspondence with officers in the quartermaster department, officers in the Army (including George Washington), and members of the Continental Congress; relating to the operation of the Quartermaster Department with requests for supplies, forage, and money. In addition, there is also correspondence between officers in the Quartermaster Department. The papers do not contain any material relating to Greene's military service or private life either before or after his tenure as quartermaster general.</p>
            <p>This collection is an ideal source for the study the logistics during the Revolutionary War, and how it effected the Continental Army both during campaigns and on a daily basis. The letters provide a detailed account of the logistical obstacles that Greene and his subordinates faced in trying to keep both the Quartermaster Department and the Continental Army running. The collection contains quartermaster returns from various departments and commands, which provide accounts of supplies on hand and supplies needed. Of particular note is the insight into the financing of the war through the consistent calls for cash from all departments, and the commentary on Continental currency in regards to the demands for payment for services and goods provided to the Army. As James T. Mitchell, chairman of the APS's Committee on Historical Manuscripts, noted, "in no place ... can a more graphic and vivid conception be gathered of the hardships and struggles of the Revolutionary army."</p>
            <p>On occasion the correspondence does touch on more exciting topics from the period. Of note are George Weedon's November 9, 1778 letter to Greene in which he discusses the birth of Greene's daughter, comments on the Rhode Island Expedition, asks for Greene's opinion on certain matters, and states his views that the British are about ready to quit. There is also Daniel Brodhead's May 26, 1779 correspondence which discusses Gen. McIntosh, Gen. Sullivan, and the Indian Expedition. Finally, there is Robert Forsyth's May 19, 1779 letter that describes the situation in Virginia. In addition to the correspondence, the Greene papers also contain the court of inquiry records into the conduct of Captain John Bancker who was Barrackmaster for part of New York, Quartermaster Department returns, and miscellaneous papers.</p>
            <p>The papers were originally arranged by Colonel Charles Pettit into 12 volumes. Pettit had served as Colonial Secretary of New Jersey under Governor William Franklin and later as Secretary of State for Governor William Livingston. He resigned as secretary in 1778 to accept the position as Assistant Quartermaster General, and held that position until the end of the war having refused the appointment of Quartermaster General after Greene's resignation. Pettit continued in public service after the war until 1792. The papers remained in the family possession until 1820 when they were donated to the American Philosophical Society through Robert Desilver. Pettit also arranged a second set of Revolutionary War documents in his possession that were first in the possession of the Bureau of Rolls and Library in the Department of State, and are now at the National Archives and Records Administration. The papers were initially calendared by the APS in 1900 by Emma Repplier under the supervision of the Committee on Historical Manuscripts. Pettit's original arrangement of the papers by volume and page number was retained at that time.</p>
            <p>To make the papers more accessible to researchers they have been reorganized into four series, and arranged therein first alphabetically by correspondent and then chronologically. The original volume and page numbers have been included in the descriptions to assist anyone using an older citation.</p>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Nathanael Greene rose from the rank of private to major-general in a short time to become one of the leading commanders in the Continental Army, and the only officer George Washington saw as capable of leading in his absence. Greene served as a field commander, member of Washington's staff, Quartermaster General, and commander of the Army in the Southern Theater. However, this military hero of the Revolution did not come from a military background, but was raised in the pacifist beliefs of a Quaker family.</p>
            <p>Greene was born on July 27, 1742 in Potowomut, Rhode Island to Nathanael and Mary Mott, who believed that their children would learn more from manual labor than school. At an early age, Greene went to work in his father's iron forge. Though lacking a formal education, Greene was innately intelligent and taught himself to read, developing a love of books - particularly military history and theory.</p>
            <p>Greene's first venture into public affairs came during the colonial crisis of the 1760s and and 1770s. After serving in the Rhode Island General Assembly from 1770 to 1772, he was among the organizers of the Kentish Guard in 1774, a militia unit formed for the protection of Rhode Island in anticipation of war. When he was rejected as an officer because of a limp he received from a childhood accident, he enlisted as a private. Greene also served on a committee authorized by the General Assembly to prepare Rhode Island's defenses, and in his spare time continued to study military science.</p>
            <p>Greene's military knowledge, likeable personality, and political influence caught the attention of the Rhode Island assembly, and in 1775 he was appointed over veteran officers of the Seven Years' War as general of the Rhode Island Army of Observation. In the following weeks he organized three regiments and led them to Boston where he reported to George Washington. It was here that Washington first became impressed with Greene, and saw his potential for greater responsibilities in the Continental Army.</p>
            <p>Greene's first year in military service however was less then distinguished. Following stalemates with the British at Boston and New York, he was placed in charge of preparing the defenses of Long Island, N.Y. In August 1776 he was promoted to major general, but fell ill and could not take the field when William Howe attacked in September. In November Greene was given command of Forts Washington and Lee across from New York City. When British troops threatened the works Greene decided not to evacuate, which resulted in the capture of both forts and 2,800 Continental troops. Despite these setbacks, Greene redeemed himself in December by providing invaluable assistance to Washington during the American retreat through New Jersey and the attack on Trenton.</p>
            <p>Throughout 1777 Greene became increasingly indispensable to Washington as both a field officer and a member of his staff. During the early summer he thwarted Howe's attacks in New Jersey. When Howe opened the Philadelphia Campaign by landing his army in Maryland, Greene played important roles at the Battles of Brandywine and Germantown, and while the army was encamped at Valley Forge he assumed a key role in supplying the troops. Thomas Mifflin had resigned as quartermaster general of the army in October 1777 over criticism from Congress and poor health. Hard pressed to find a replacement, Washington turned to Greene to handle matters of supply. Out of respect for Washington's wishes Greene reluctantly accepted the position of quartermaster general in March 1778 on the condition that he maintain his rank as a field commander and be able to appoint John Cox and Charles Pettit as his assistant quartermasters-general. Although Greene believed the position was beneath him, he managed to improve the movement of supplies to the troops. During his two years in command of the department, Greene set up forage depots at key locations, took on the problem of transportation, and wrestled with Congress to get money to purchase the supplies the army needed. While Greene and his assistants struggled to supply the army in the face of inflation, they were accused of profiteering by Congress. Shortly thereafter, Greene learned that Congress had elected to hold the quartermaster general personally and financially responsible for the actions of his subordinates. After two years of continuous, aggravating, and thankless work this was the final act for Greene. On July 26, 1780 he resigned as quartermaster general.</p>
            <p>Returning to his field command on June 28, 1778, Greene took command from Charles Lee who had ordered a retreat against Washington's wishes during the the Battle of Monmouth. Greene assisted John Sullivan in planning his Rhode Island Campaign in 1778, and on June 23, 1780 he was in command at Springfield, NJ when British troops under Baron Wilhelm von Knyphausen advanced from New York City. Greene's chance for independent command came in October 1780. Congress had relieved Horatio Gates as general of the southern army after allowing the British under Lord Cornwallis to take control of South Carolina and Georgia. In an effort to prevent the loss of North Carolina and Virginia, Congress authorized Washington to select Gates' replacement. Without hesitation Washington selected Greene, who immediately set out for the south. During the journey he added Henry "Light-Horse Harry" Lee's legion to his command and placed Baron Friedrich von Steuben in charge of organizing men and supplies. Greene arrived at Charlotte, N.C. on December 3 to relieve Gates of his command. Knowing that Cornwallis was waiting for reinforcements at Winnsboro, S.C., Greene decided to attack before they could arrive. With the assistance of Daniel Morgan, he launched a campaign in early 1781 that included the Battle of Cowpens on January 17 and the Battle of Guilford Courthouse on March 15, both American victories, that forced Cornwallis to withdraw to Virginia, while Greene took what remained of his command south after militia departures.</p>
            <p>For the remainder of the war Greene worked with partisan forces against 8,000 British troops garrisoned throughout South Carolina and Georgia. Despite facing a larger force, he was able to force the British to withdraw from their interior posts to the coastal cities. Even after Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown Greene continued to contend with British forces who held Charleston and Savannah until 1782, and to restore peace between patriots and Loyalists who continued to battle one another. It was not until after the peace treaty was signed that Greene was able to end his military career.</p>
            <p>In 1783 Greene returned north a hero. In appreciation of his military service in the south, Greene received large estates from South Carolina and Georgia. After spending two years in the north Greene and his wife decided to settle in Georgia on their plantation Mulberry Grove.</p>
            <p>The last years of Green's life were troubled by resurfacing accusations of profiteering during the war, and by a large debt which resulted when a note he had cosigned came due. Even though the charges of profiteering were disproved, but the debt remained. Greene died at Mulberry Grove on June 19, 1786 from an infection, leaving his family in financial uncertainty until Congress liquidated his debts ten years later.</p>

Finnie of Virginia, that their bay is full of the enemy's cruisers, which prevents him from sending any of the forage to the Head of the Elk. Has written to Col. Pettit to suggest to the Committee of Congress the advisability of clearing the bay. Rumor from Congress of some foreign intelligence of great importance raised the valuation of money, but only for the moment. Hopes the publication of the good news will add to the money's value.</p>

                        <p>Springfield - Account of the appearance of the enemy with eleven or twelve sail of brigs, sloops and row-galleys heading toward Crain's Ferry. The General not being able to see their rear, and supposing they were coming in force, called all the militia out and moved down in force to receive them; but they turned and stood up Newark bay and then up Hackensack river; they had some supplies for the troops there and will also render that river a defense by their armed vessels. They have in their power near one-half of Bergen county. Surmises as to their intentions, and detailing their various movements.</p>

                        <p>Springfield - Informing him of the advent of the enemy the day before and the damage to property. Asks him to use his influence with His Excellency to have the whole or part of the Jersey brigade stationed somewhere near Westfield. The magazines of hay are of vast importance and the State troops on duty are insufficient even to alarm the country - i.e.: the enemy reached Bound Brook a little after sunrise and the alarm was given at Elizabethtown around 11 o'clock. 4000 militia ordered by Legislature to be in readiness but only to turn out at the advent of the French fleet. Stores in imminent danger. Note - The foregoing letter is from Rev. Dr. Caldwell, whose wife was killed by the British on June 7, 1780, and himself shot in November 1781. They left nine children.</p>

                        <p>Boston - Acknowledging his favor of the 29th ult. Surprised at complaints made against him by the Commissary Department. Would like to know who made the complaint; things there has been as much expedition shown in his department as in any on the Continent. Teamsters are paid any price to transport private property from Boston, and naturally they prefer it to carting public stores. Brewer has returned without money and therefore will not be able to send on the stores. Salt stopped on the road owing to not having a pass.</p>

                        <p>Boston - The bearer, Mr. Brewer, has the charge of 100 lbs. of powder. No more stores can be procured without an immediate supply of money, as teamsters insist upon being paid as soon as the work is done. Generally by the time they received their money, it had depreciated one-half. Difficulty of procuring the teams even by paying the money down.</p>

                        <p>Ringwood - Enemy's designs difficult to interpret from his movements; they have fallen back to King's Ferry again, after being in full view of the fortifications at West Point, without attempting to make any impression upon the works. Loss of a little of fort by Gen. McDougall on the east side of King's Ferry. Enemy's purpose to cut off their communication with the Eastern States. Difficulty of subsisting their cattle and keeping up the necessary transportation through such a barren country. Plans for subsisting the troops in case West Point is invested, and for transporting provisions and forage. Necessity for removing clothing at Middlebrook as fast as possible to somewhere back of Morristown.</p>

Unless effectual measures are immediately taken to open the eyes of the Treasury and induce them to furnish a very considerable sum to the Quartermaster department, supplies expected from his quarter must assuredly cease. Mr. Pettit only received a small fraction of the cash needed. Suggests the immediate surrender of all appointments and offices, to arouse those at the helm to a sense of their duty. Desires information respecting the boats, also the troops' winter quarters. Mr. Pettit's opinion, and his also, that money will soon be more valuable than any article at the present price. Mr. Pettit's plan, therefore, to turn all their concerns in shipping into cash.</p>

Grain of no grain, the provisions must come on to the army; if necessary, the cattle must eat grass.</p>

Even the General, although acting on the defensive, cannot determine this point, for it all depends on the enemy's movements. Wants pasture for horses provided along the route from Middlebrook. Herculean task on their hands. Afraid good news from the South will turn out to be false.</p>

Sorry that the late oppressive law in his State, dangerous to the rights of citizens as well as to the privileges of officers, has forced him to this measure.

Quantity of long forage in the quarter where the troops will pitch their tents.

                        <p>Morristown - Acknowledging favor of 17th inst., and promising to make up the number of horses. As for the men, thinks a line from His Excellency, Gen. Washington, to the Governor for one militia company will prevent delay. In his opinion, nothing of consequence has yet been proved against Mr. Lewis, and the public suffers merely to gratify private spleen. Longs to hear of the arrival of the French fleet. Advices from Georgia put fresh spirits in the people. Exorbitant price of forage; the more money issued the more it depreciates. Intends applying to the Assembly for some relief. They might follow a law lately passed in New York respecting forage. Salary in his department so low that he has great difficulty in keeping the men in the service.</p>

Debt of the department to the artificers ought to be paid in money or clothes. Concerning his accounts. Will go to Congress on his own affairs as soon as Major Hale returns.

                        <p>Fishkill - Smiths and wheelwrights determined to leave unless their wages are raised. By the offer of such extravagant wages, Mr. Simmons has a second time depreciated the money. He [Col. Hay] is even suspected of pocketing that part of the wages which, by leaving the post, the artificers can easily get elsewhere. Suggests procuring artificers from the regiment. Matter of cordage. Need of a proper public tanner. Pay for teams. Concerning the completion of the works at West Point during the coming summer. Hopes Gen. Greene is homeward bound, loaded with money.

                        <p>Fishkill - Praise for his assistants. Gen. Greene's recommendation to Congress to advance assistant quartermaster's pay to $ 140 per month at first sight appears generous; on second thought, considers it inadequate to their services, considering their expenses. Must raise artificers' wages or lose them. Officers of artificers beg dismission from the service, producing certificates to show that their families are starving for bread, - no wonder! with wheat at $ 25 per bushel!</p>

                        <p>Fishkill - The bearer, Mr. Stewart, is on his way to King's Ferry to take charge as quartermaster, and waits for instructions. Col. Hubbard cannot get a yard of duck in his State. Advices a halt in the building of the bateaux - no boards will be left for many necessary objects. Gives return of bateaux at Wappen's creek. Caulker needed. Wages of artificers. Smiths demanding equal wages with those in Philadelphia, "that sink of pollution." Without money transportation must stop. Wheelwrights demand a raise in their wages.</p>

Nothing can save his department from ruin, and the army from disbanding but the adoption of a new mode of obtaining forage; explains this in detail. The impending storm could have been averted by an opportune supply of cash.</p>

Would rather be the agent for his own State (if it comes into the measure) than risk the embarrassments arising from a State quartermaster. Constitution failing him under the fatigues and annoyances of his position. Busy with cash accounts. Most of their debts to artificers, master of vessels and wagoners, who depend only on this money for the support of themselves and family. In case Congress sends a supply of wheat, has chosen a safe place for storing it. Lack of wagoners. Question of a debt to a ropemaker. Desires printed certificates to give those who bring in accounts and cannot be paid.</p>

Enemy have plundered New Haven, burnt Fairfield, and are now ranging the country, and committing all kinds of depredations.

Sullivan may require of Col. Hooper.</p>

Mr. Furman has already resigned and Col. Cox and Mr. Pettit only wait to know the issue of a memorial presented to Congress. Should they resign, will not be responsible for the terrible consequences, neither will he take any fee or reward for his services in that event. Has heard some doubts about the holding of his command. If, by serving on the staff, he should lose the honors of the line he could never be repaid, nor could he ever serve in the department during another campaign.</p>

Money nearly expended; would like about $ 30,000; in case of the arrival of troops, has barracks in Albany for 440 men and at Schenectady and Saratoga for as many more.</p>

Thinks, however, that the business of his department has been transacted at a much cheaper rate than any other; can prove this. Quartermaster-General's appointment not a profitable one in his district. Various supplies of boats and their materials sent to Col. Hay; building six bateaux daily.</p>

                        <p>Albany - Acknowledging letter of 19th ult. Promises to adopt the mode he prescribes for acquiring an exact account of moneys due from the department. Has mentioned it already to some of his creditors in the city; they declined to accept of any certificate in lieu of money, even threatening a prosecution. People distressed for money to pay their taxes; and those living at a distance will certainly not bring in their accounts to receive only a promise of payment. Those driven from their habitations in 1777, demand payment for boards, etc., taken from them on the retreat. His assistants dissatisfied, and properly so, with their payment; they will leave unless something is done. Desires to know the truth of a report tat a Resolution of Congress allows the staff clothing. Complains bitterly against the rate at which he has been taxed, as he has no visible property on earth and has been taxed merely for doing Gen. Greene's business.</p>

                        <p>Headquarters, Peekskill - Acknowledging favor of 11th ult. Grand Army left everything in chaos. Gen. Greene's department in the best state. Detention of intrenching tools. Dissipation and luxury in Philadelphia; its consequences. Congress of New York aim to do everything with small results. Works at West Point retarded for want of carpenters. Hard worked; leads Spartan life. Affairs in Georgia cannot prosper until people recover from their panic. Wants to know what Congress is doing with Gen. Arnold. Alliance with France. Expectations not sanguine from that quarter; America must, under God, rely on herself; she must pay her own debts and restore her currency.</p>

Number of tents ready to send on; unable to keep workmen supplied with canvas, which is extravagantly dear. £222 per bolt. Enclosing returns for September. People employed cannot live on their pay. The assistants complain that they are not put on a footing with Col. Four's men and officers, who are allowed clothing; cannot purchase clothing out of their pay. Blankets cannot be got. Proper to have a person at North Wales or near it; compliment of naming the man will be paid to the President, who is much indisposed from fatigue of body and mind, due to the unfortunate disputes in Philadelphia.</p>

Advice he gave Mr. Mitchell. Thinks Mr. M's conduct has been indiscreet but nothing more. The whole affair of a delicate and embarrassing nature.</p>

Mr. Mitchell's efforts to extricate himself only seem to plunge him into deeper distress; has begged him [Pettit] to soften his case before the Council . Wrote a private letter to the President on the subject, setting forth his belief that Mr. Mitchell may have been indiscreet but never fraudulent; the President's answer expressed a different opinion of his conduct. No hope, therefore, in that direction.

The department injured by conduct of certain officers in Lancaster and Delaware. Fears concerning Col. Patton's character; for further information refers Gen. Greene to Gen. Smallwood's chaplain, Mr. Montgomery.</p>

                        <p>New Windsor - Gen. Washington has moved his quarters to New Windsor, visiting West Point nearly every day and usually requiring Gen. Greene's attendance. Also he has been one of a Board of General Officers to decide upon the cases of a number of officers escaped from the enemy and charged by them with breach of parole. The affair of the tax in New Jersey. Resignation of Mr. Furman. Sympathizes with Col. Pettit in his terribly embarrassed state. Artificers ready to mutiny for certain rights. Resolve of Congress, fixing the wages of wagon hire, totally ineffectual. Must not let army suffer for a little paltry saving. Alarming state of the fixed ammunition. Want of lead from Boston. Sir Harry Clinton has drawn off greater part of his force from King's Ferry, leaving strongly fortified garrison; has fallen down towards New York; ignorant where he is or what he is about. Will cost £300,000 to complete fortification of West Point. No official news from South Carolina; tired of changing his opinion on the subject.</p>

                        <p>West Point - Acknowledging letters of 16th and 17th insts. Late resolutions of Congress, putting the staff wholly in the power of the executive officers of each state, will give finishing stroke to their department. Discusses the alarming results if he (Gen. Greene) is to be excluded from the honors of the line; will quit the department at once; his rank preserved by Act of Congress and his claim a just one. Gov. Read and other members likely to feel the effects of that jealousy among the people, which they have been so industrious in promoting.</p>

                        <p>West Point - Tyrannical Act of Congress concerning the staff; cannot think of it without falling into a passion; number of resignations caused by it. Late Act of Congress, of 9th inst., more mischievous in its consequences. Unless repealed, Col. Hay and all those acting under him will resign. Staff painted in such black colors by Congress that the resulting distress among the people makes all business extremely difficult; has written his sentiments to Congress, so that if they do sin, it will be with their eyes open. Any action taken respecting Col. Coxe's resignation? Settling of accounts an important matter. Col. Biddle must have money; as everything depends upon forage department; he also is determined to resign. Lord Cornwallis just arrived from England to take command of the British army. Sir William Erskine gone home. British army drawing all their forces to York Island; main body of American army at West Point, but a detachment covers Connecticut and another New Jersey; one under Lord Stirling, the other under Gen. Howe. Seriously alarmed for the Indian Expedition, it progresses so slowly; thinks Tioga will terminate the affair. Raid of party of Indians under command of Brand. Duke de Sally's reputation of always being unsuccessful will be confirmed, if he allows Indians to ravage frontiers.</p>

                        <p>Philadelphia - Concerning his presentation on behalf of Gen. Greene of the locket, and Mrs. Mitchell's graceful acceptance of it. Question of the tradesman's bill and the exorbitant price of gold. State of his feelings toward the Treasury. Account of terrible arrears in his department and his numerous appeals, few of which were granted; suspects partiality to other departments. Desires his and Mr. Weiss' advice on the best means of preparing an account of expenditures.</p>

                        <p>Philadelphia - Account of a conversation held with the Treasury Board, in which he set forth in quite a long speech the need for money and the tardiness with which it was supplied, especially to his department. Letter of the 1st inst. from Col. Biddle mentioning the situation of the army as three miles west of Morris; desires an order on the Treasury for $ 500,000 to provide for the cavalry. Resolve of Congress to draw bills on Europe at six months' sight for £200,000 sterling; also to move from Philadelphia the next spring, but not yet determined whither. Suffering from inflammation of one eye, which may prevent his writing.</p>

Number of wagons ordered, and those still wanted, to go with the Virginia troops. Mr. Hollingsworth must have the necessary shipping provided to carry the troops from Head of Elk to Petersburg. Col. Pettit must furnish Captain Young with cash, as he is to accompany the troops on their march as deputy quartermaster-general.</p>

                        <p>Philadelphia - Acknowledging letter of 24th inst. Announcing his appointment as one of the Managers of the Assembly; does not like to decline as it might knock up the amusement or bring the Tories into consequence again, just as they are humbly coming to amusements as visitors on their good behavior. Col. Mitchell shines in the administration of the laws of the Assembly. Sends him by Thomas McDowell, express-rider, $ 171,000, but warms him that he will get no more. Obliged to send many messengers away empty. Two or three new Committees of Congress appointed respecting supplies; they are calling for estimates and returns, scarcely knowing what they ask for, or what to do with the answers when they get them.</p>

Effect on the arrangements of his department of the late law passed in Jersey for purchasing. Congress acting as though they wanted to get him and his agents out of the way, and had not nearly spirit enough to say so. Reasons against his resigning. Things in a bad way. Stream of new money dried up. Taxes inadequate to meet the demands. Domestic loans looked at askance by the prudent.</p>

Can do nothing without money, which he cannot get. Congress doing nothing to the point. Surprised at Col. Mitchell's delaying so long at camp when his presence is needed in Philadelphia. Insufficient number of teams employed in carrying provisions for him to Trenton; afraid to give other than general directions, as Col. Mitchell is expected every day.</p>

Trouble with the Treasury Board over orders they gave him, and which now they decline to be responsible for. High complaints against Col. Cook; has written him a letter on the subject. Things going from bad to worse - miserable condition of horses, lack of money and pressure of creditors, and no disposition on the part of his superiors to lessen the difficulties. Remarkable manner in which the public debts are annihilated - on paper.</p>

Hope in future they will have less reason to complain of inattention to their requests. Differs totally with Col. Pettit as to their power of examining the quartermaster's books; they do not ask the certificates as a matter of favor, but of clear and undoubted right. On verso - Acknowledging the receipt of His Excellency's favor of equal date. Concerning a certificate of discharge which the Council desires Mr. Mitchell to send them. Defends himself and also Mr. Mitchell against the charge of "throwing delays and difficulties in the way of inquiries into the conduct of Continental officers."</p>

Mr. Pettit having since made an application in form, everything shall be done as soon as possible. Objections to having any extraordinary powers vested in the Deputy Quartermasters; one gentleman, as they personally know, employed the whole influence of his department to disgrace and overthrow the Government. Concessions they will make to gen. Sullivan; asks him to favor the inhabitants as much as possible; wishing him all success. Will furnish sundry blank warrants to be used when he needs wagons.</p>

Unhappy situation of the people for want of bread. Enormous cost of wheat and pork. Disappointed to find the money of as little value as at Philadelphia. Fears for another campaign. People chagrined that a much severer sentence was not passed on Gen. Lee. The gentlemen of Virginia exasperated against R. H. Lee. Compliments to Mrs. Greene; hopes his and their lottery tickets will be successful as it is really necessary. Expects to shake him by the hand the beginning of March.</p>

Plenty of wood and water there, and though not many comfortable houses for the quarters of General officers, still enough to make shift with. Will join his division in a day or two unless His Excellency should wish him to remain where he is. Intelligence of a fleet sailing from New York with 800 troops said to be fore the West Indies; no such news at Gen. Maxwell's quarters, but certain that they are preparing for an embarkation.</p>

Enemy landed at Sandy Point, October 26, 1779, at midnight; marched to Quibbletown, destroyed stores there, went to Rariton and destroyed boats and the Dutch church in that place, then to Millstone; released ten prisoners from gaol and set fire to courthouse. Near Brunswick, encountered party of our people, who killed their commander's horse and took him prisoner. The rest of the enemy went off towards South Amboy, where they fell in with Capt. Voorhees, who was obliged to surrender; "notwithstanding, the infernal rascals cut him to pieces."</p>

                        <p>Wilmington - Has not heard of Gen. Pulaski or any of his legion; has given instructions, however, about their reception. Difficulty of getting forage for the horses. Scarce a farmer within a radius of thirty miles will sell any grain. A prodigious saving of forage if the teams could be laid off until the navigation is open. Orders from Gen. Smallwood, for certain men employed by him to return to their regiments, a great detriment to the service, as he has no others to replace them with. Exceedingly troublesome force of about one hundred men under a lieutenant stationed at this post and robbing the inhabitants.</p>

Unless money is provided, all supplies for the opening of the campaign will fall short. Lack of provisions for men and forage for horses at nearly all the posts that have been forwarding supplies for the army. For this reason has been obliged to let most of the teams withdraw from the service.</p>

                        <p>Headquarters - Acknowledging favor of 28th inst. Nothing can be done toward the Canada expedition that winter; scanty supply of provisions afforded by the country at the head of Connecticut River. Will forbid the sending up of flour from Albany. Collecting and repairing of bateaux. Has fixed upon Danbury, West Point and Middlebrook for cantoning the army during the winter; number of brigades at these points to be regulated by the strength of the enemy. Probability of throwing a regiment into the Clove near Sufferans and placing a brigade at Albany. If the enemy keep a garrison at New York it will be of sufficient strength to repel any attack the Americans could make; would therefore lay aside all idea of collecting his force suddenly and extend his view to more remote cantonments. Good barracks at Trenton and Burlington; also wheat and mills in the vicinity. Advises removing provisions from the Sound to the foot of the mountain. Necessity of collecting materials for hutting.</p>

                        <p>Headquarters, Morristown - Concerning the dispossession of Capt. De. Rochefontaine of his quarters in favor of Lt. Col. Stevens. Unfortunate that such things should happen to any officers, but particularly to a foreign gentleman; wishes the affair rectified and put upon a proper footing. Has received Mr. Conduit's letter; Gen. Lee in that part of the country; trying to prevent the intercourse of which he speaks, but seems impracticable to put a stop to it.</p>

Has leased a farm not to far from town, where his friends will always receive a hearty welcome, and if Mrs. Greene will come, promises her a ball every week. Great hopes at the beginning of the Rhode Island expedition, disappointed. Desires his opinion on the state of the arm, on the results of the Court-martial and the Eastern pole tax. Thinks the British are pretty tired and would gladly quit. Assembly still sitting; will communicate the heads of their deliberations in his next.</p>

                        <p>West Point - His situation different from his brethren in office, on account of his being annexed to the line of the army; therefore ought to be treated on the same footing with a captain in the line, as was done in May, 1777. Has no aversion to the service, its hard work and inadequate pay, but thinks the sacrifice too great unless he has a prospect of being on a level with the officers of the line. Begs him to state the matter to the Quartermaster-General and request him to lay it before Congress, in which case he is willing to continue his services until January 1.</p>

If he has to continue defraying his own expenses, will be ruined. Carelessness and villainy of wagoners.</p>
