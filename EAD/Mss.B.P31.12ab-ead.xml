            <p>These two letterbooks contain the correspondence of Reubens Peale primarily to his family. One dates from 1802-1814. In it, Reubens discusses a variety of topics. Some letters describe his social life and current events, while many others deal with museum issues. One letter, written from England, details a magic trick he witnessed that he thought would be popular in the museum.</p>
            <p>The second volume (b) is much smaller and contains carbon copies of letters dated from Baltimore in 1824. These letters are primarily to family members and sometimes business associates. They chronicle Reubens’ life as the head of the Baltimore Museum.</p>

            <p>Rubens Peale managed his father's museum in Philadelphia from 1810 to 1822. At that time, he bought his brother Rembrandt's controlling interest in the Peale Museum in Baltimore. He also opened branches in New York City and in Utica, New York. He eventually sold his collection to P. T. Barnum.</p>
