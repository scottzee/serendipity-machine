            <p>
                <emph render="bold">David Francis Barry</emph> was born on March 6, 1854, near Rochester, New York, to Irish immigrant parents. When he was seven years of age, he and his family moved to Wisconsin. As early as 1870, Barry met O. S. Goff, performing menial tasks such as carrying water for the photographer. Little is known of the next eight years of Barry's life. In 1878, he followed Goff to the Dakota Territory; Goff hired Barry as an apprentice to assist him in his Bismarck gallery. The friendship and close-working relationship would grow, with Barry eventually becoming Goff's business partner. Between 1878 and 1883, utilizing a portable photographic studio, Barry traveled throughout the Plains to Fort Buford, Fort Yates, and Fort Assiniboine in Montana, taking photographs as he went. Maintaing a presence in and around Bismarck for the next seven years, in 1890 he returned to Wisconsin. Barry opened a studio and gallery in Superior, and his Dakota Territory photographs became a commercial success. Apart from a brief move to New York City around 1892, Barry remained in Superior until his death in 1934. Barry is best known for the images he took of Native American leaders--including Sitting Bull, Gall, Rain in the Face, Red Cloud, and Shooting Star--some of which are in this collection. He established a close working relationship and friendship with his subjects, and was close in particular to Lakota warrior Rain in the Face. Barry was dubbed "Little Shadow Catcher" by his Native American friends and served as the photographer of the 10-year anniversary event of the Battle of the Little Bighorn.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Orlando Scott Goff </emph> was born on September 10, 1843, the youngest son of a prosperous shoemaker in Connecticut. A Civil War veteran who served his country for four years, Goff fought in the 10th Connecticut Infantry regiment. He suffered gunshot wounds to his chest and right arm during his service. After the war, Goff studied photography in Lyons, New York and moved west. After a brief period as an itinerant photographer in Portage, Wisconsin, where he met David F. Barry, Goff moved to Yankton (1871) and Bismarck (1873), Dakota Territory, setting up photographic studios in each town. He would often travel outside of his studio, capturing images across the Plains. He worked as the post photographer for Fort Abraham Lincoln where George Custer and the Seventh Cavalry were stationed. He also photographed numerous Native American subjects. Goff retired from the photography business in 1900, and served one term in the Montana House of Representatives (1907-1908), before moving to Idaho where he passed away in 1916. Goff took a number of famous photographs during his career including the last known image of George Custer (1876), the first known image of Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce, and the first photograph of Sitting Bull after his surrender (1881).</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">George W. Scott</emph> was a photographer who operated out of the Dakotas and Wyoming, from 1883 to the early 1900s. Born on March 21, 1854 in Washington, D.C., Scott initially pursued an education in business, studying at Duff's Commerical College in Pittsburgh. While in the steel city, he also worked in a glass factory and as a painter. He then made his way west as a member of the U.S. signal corps, settling in Deadwood, South Dakota. He quit the service in 1883, and for the next four years worked strictly as a photographer. Rejoining the signal service in 1887, he moved around the Dakotas, all the while dabbling in photography. He worked out of Bismarck, Fort Yates, and Yankton. In 1894, he moved to Lander, Wyoming and set up the first photographic studio in that town.</p>
            <p>Photographer 
                <emph render="bold">Camillus "Buck" Sydney Fly</emph> (2 May 1849 â€“ 12 October 1901) is most noted for the many photographs he took in and around Tombstone, Arizona, where he witnessed the "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" (1881). In March, 1886, Fly traveled with General George Crook to the Canyon de Los Embudos for the negotiations with the Apache leader Geronimo. Fly gained fame for the photographs he took of the subsequent negotiations, and the images he took of Geronimo and his followers, taken on March 25 and 26th. These images are noteworthy as they are the only existing photographs taken of Native Americans while at war with the United States.</p>
            <p>A Missourian by birth, 
                <emph render="bold">William E. Irwin</emph> (1871-1935) learned photography in his early twenties in either the Indian Territory or Texas. Throughout his career, he operated galleries in Chickasha, Oklahoma; Silver City, New Mexico; Bisbee, Arizona; and Douglas, Arizona.</p>
            <p>Businessmen 
                <emph render="bold">Dr. George P. Dix, Joshua Bradford Bailey, and John L. Mead</emph>, attempting to capitalize on the popularity of images of the "Wild West," patronized various photographers to create photographic series of Native Americans.</p>
