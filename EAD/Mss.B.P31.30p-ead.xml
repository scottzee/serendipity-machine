            <p>This collection consists of four bound journal books and mixed materials. What follows is a desription of this content.</p>
            <p>Bound Volumes One, George Escol Sellers journal, contains information on early American mechanical engineering. The volume contains a number of sketches of various tools and machines, including steam powered ones. There are also a couple of pencil sketches of individuals, landscapes, and a watercolor of the ocean.</p>
            <p>The second volume (#30) is a diary his sister Anna kept in 1898 and intended for him to have.</p>
            <p>The final two volumes appear to be George Escol Sellers attempts to preserve the memory of Nathan Sellers by compiling various accounts of him. Many are personal memories that also often provide insight on Philadelphia life and society in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. There are also accounts of Sellers’ service in during the Revolutionary War. According to family memory, during his service, Nathan Sellers created the first paper moulds in America on Washington’s orders because of a shortage of writing paper. Finally, there are newspaper clippings and other material that contain references to Nathan Sellers, particularly as they relate to his invention of a rolling gate that made water mills more efficient.</p>
            <p>In addition to the manuscripts and clippings, there are four artifacts included in the collection: a wire card, a piece of wire for making paper moulds, and two examples of brass wire Nathan Sellers produced.</p>
            <p>Mixed Materials The mixed materials (not bound) are primarily documents chronicling family and Philadelphia history and George Escol Seller’s own autobiography. Some it has to do with Sellers involvement in creating machines and other issues dealing with industrialization. There is a detailed description of how the U.S. Mint transitioned from hand coinage to steam powered machine production, which Sellers helped facilitate. There is also G.E. Sellers unpublished memoirs, which also contain genealogical data.</p>
            <p>In addition to the various manuscript sources, the collection has many sketches in pencil and watercolor that showcase George Escol Seller’s artistic abilities. The sketches are often of the Pennsylvania countryside or scenes of Philadelphia although there are also some portraits of individuals.</p>
            <p>Finally, manuscripts in box BP31-30P contain the carbon copies of G.E. Sellers outgoing correspondence. This box also contains a manuscript of his recollections of his father, Coleman Sellers.</p>
