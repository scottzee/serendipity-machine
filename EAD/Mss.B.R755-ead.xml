            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">This collection of correspondence and documents focuses on Roughton's prolific life's work on respiratory physiology. His specific work at Cambridge University from the 1920s to the 1960s, as well as interludes in the U. S. during World War II, are covered, as is the scientific milieu in which he worked. Some of the subjects or organizations for which there are documents, are: Bermuda and Naples Zoological Research Stations; British Glue and Gelatin Research Assoc.; Biochemical Journal; Cambridge Philosophical Society; Cambridge University Departments of Physiology (pre-1939) and Colloid Science (post-1940); Harvard Fatique Lab.; Medical research Council; Trinity College Cambridge.</abstract>

            <p>The researches of the British scientist Francis J. W. Roughton on the physiology of blood and the physical biochemistry of hemoglobin are part of an intellectual tradition which included the British physiologists Joseph Barcroft, J. S. and J. B. S. Haldane, and A. V. Hill. In fact, Barcroft's and Hill's influence on Roughton was akin to mentorship. During the 1920s Roughton worked at Cambridge University on problems of oxygen diffusion in the blood, studies for which he was appointed Lecturer in Physical Biochemistry and in Physico-Chemical Physiology.</p>
            <p>Roughton's research during the next four decades generally followed out of his work in the 1920s. That is, his early studies on diffusion were later broadened to include chemical reaction processes, theoretical and experimental analyses of factors that determine the rates of penetration of oxygen and carbon monoxide into red blood cells, and the transport of carbon dioxide in the blood. His measurements of oxygen association curves were important in elucidating the action of hemoglobin. In 1946 Roughton became chairman of the Department of Colloid Science at Cambridge, a center for research on surface chemistry and biophysical chemistry.</p>
            <p>Roughton developed a successful research program in England, but was happier in America, where he lectured and conducted research during his extended visits. He spent much of World War II in the United States working on war projects such as carbon monoxide shock and studies in aviation medicine at the Harvard Fatigue Laboratory and the Physiological Laboratory of Columbia's Medical School; he remained associated with military research on blood physiology well past the war. In the 1950s and 1960s he also spent several semesters at the University of Pennsylvania, working closely with his colleague (and former student) Britton Chance. Because of the close bonds that Roughton had with American science, his papers have been deposited at the APS.</p>
            <p>This enormous collection contains notebooks, drafts of papers, manuscripts, lecture notes, calculations, laboratory manuals, annotated books from Roughton's personal library, reprints, photographs, and voluminous correspondence. The papers document Roughton's research in Cambridge and America, his war activities, and broader aspects of physiology, biophysics, and physical biochemistry.</p>

            <p>
                <emph render="underline">Britton Chance</emph> was educated first at the University of Pennsylvania, obtaining a doctorate in 1940. A two-year association with F. J. W. Roughton, a specialist in the biochemistry and biophysics of hemoglobin, culminated in 1942 in a second doctorate from Cambridge University. Chance returned to the University of Pennsylvania to become professor of biophysics and biochemistry and director of the Eldridge Reeves Johnson Foundation. Under his leadership, the Department of Biophysics and Physical Biochemistry became a world center for the study of cell metabolism.</p>
            <p>During the 1940s, Chance's research program focused mainly on enzyme kinetics of peroxidases, physico-chemical studies that elucidated in minute detail the mechanisms of formation of enzyme-substrate complexes. Broadened in scope in the 1950s, the research included the study of phosphorylation mechanisms in mitochondria and cytochromes. In general, by introducing new biochemical methods, especially sensitive photometric techniques, Chance was able to explain various physiological states of cell metabolism in vivo.</p>
