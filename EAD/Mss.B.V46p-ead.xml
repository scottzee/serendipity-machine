            <p>The Benjamin Vaughan Papers contain an extensive amount of correspondence and other documents. MOLE contains a detailed inventory of its holdings. Vaughan was a prominent figure in the revolutionary Atlantic. This large collection captures the complex and high profile life Benjamin led. He was born in the Caribbean but grew up in London. He became a friend of Franklin and his circle in London in the 1770s. During the War for Independence, he served as an emissary to the peace negotiations between the U.S. and British. He then spent a few years in Switzerland before emigrating to the United States with his wife. They settled in Maine, where Vaughan dabbled in speculation, farming, and other pursuits. His brother John became active in the American Philosophical Society.</p>

            <p>The Vaughan Papers contains a substantial representation of the voluminous correspondence and writings of Benjamin Vaughan, focussed on his relationship with the Earl of Shelburne, Benjamin Franklin, and other members of the Vaughan Family. Consisting primarily of manuscript letters received by Vaughan, typescript copies of letters to him, and incidental essays, notes, financial papers, and legal documents, the collection is particularly strong in documenting Vaughan's life just prior to his emigration to America through until his death.</p>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Benjamin Vaughan lived through all the vicissitudes of an enlightened life during the age of revolution. Born in Jamaica to Samuel Vaughan, a merchant and planter, and Sarah Hallowell, a native Bostonian, Vaughan was raised in London and educated at Cambridge and Lincoln's Inn. At university, he fell in with the coterie of Joseph Priestley, Benjamin Franklin, Jeremy Bentham, and William Petty, the Earl of Shelburne, and imbibed many of their unorthodox, perhaps radical political, social, and religious views. Whether a product of his own colonial origins or his contact with Franklin, Priestley, and Price, Vaughan took a particularly keen interest in American affairs, advocating reconciliation throughout the Revolutionary conflict. In 1783, as a result of his connections to then-Prime Minister Shelburne and his association with Franklin (having seen to the English publication of the first volume of Franklin's political writings), Vaughan was dispatched to Paris to mollify Franklin and the American negotiators and assure them of good English intentions. Although he was barred as a dissenter from any official role in the negotiations, Vaughan played an important unofficial role in quickening the closure of the treaty and the formalization and recognition of American independence.</p>
            <p>As Vaughan's political and diplomatic star was rising, his improbable pursuit of the hand of Sarah Manning, the daughter of an ardent Tory, led him to study medicine in Edinburgh to establish his name as a reputable suitor. Although he never completed his studies, he did marry Sarah in 1781, joining her father's mercantile business shortly thereafter, and he maintained an active interest in medical affairs for much of the remainder of his life. He remained loyal to Shelburne after Shelburne's departure from the ministry in 1784, and was elected to represent Calne in Parliament in 1793. However in the backlash against republicanism, Vaughan's political views and his sympathy for the French Revolution conspired to make him obnoxious to the majority of the government, if not the people, and when war with France erupted in February, 1793, he began to feel the heat. As a result, when called before the Privy Council in May, 1794, he decided that flight was the better part of valor and took off for America, where his popularity was undiminished, by way of France. Ironically, as a foreign national arriving in Paris during the most radical phase of the Revolution, he was immediately arrested and imprisoned. Released in July, Vaughan remained in Switzerland and France for over three years before receiving a passport to join his wife and children in the United States.</p>
            <p>Settling on family lands in the nether reaches of Hallowell, Maine, Vaughan worked his land, speculated (like many of his contemporaries) in real estate, and maintained an active correspondence with his wide circle of intellectual acquaintances, including his brother John long-time Librarian of the American Philosophical Society. In this remote outpost, he amassed one of the largest private libraries in New England, almost 12,000 volumes, and continued to take part in political discussions with American officials at the highest level, though he never again held elective office. A committed Federalist and a proponent of harmonious relations between England and America, he was a vocal critic of the War of 1812 and his social and political philosophy led him consistently to oppose American westward and southward expansion. Vaughan died in 1835.</p>

                    <p>Manuscript letters to and from Benjamin Vaughan, arranged chronologically, with particularly rich correspondence with Franklin, Shelburne, and members of the Vaughan family, as well as a small number of ancillary documents and correspondence relating to financial and estate matters. A number of items from the period before 1790 are typescript copies of originals held in other institutions or in private hands.</p>
                    <p>After about 1798, the correspondence is largely confined to members of the family, particularly Charles, William, Petty, and Sarah Vaughan. While some of the family correspondence is inevitably consumed with financial and other family matters, the full range of Vaughan's interests emerges, including his political, social, scientific, and familial concerns. A grasping intellect, Vaughan had a through grounding in philosophical and religious issues, but he had a strong interest as well in useful, applied knowledge. As such, his correspondence runs both toward the theoretical -- on moral philosophy, political theory, religious doctrine, or scientific schemes -- and the practical from bridges to diseases, taxation, animal husbandry, agriculture, internal improvements, medical practice, and political practice.</p>
                    <p>The general correspondence series includes a few essays and sets of notes on topical issues, including English foreign policy (ca. 1792), relations with France (ca. 1792), slavery (ca. 1792), and yellow fever (1795), and in the undated materials, items relating to the last illness and death of Joseph Priestley, fire engines, inoculation, and various mechanical inventions. The majority of such manuscripts have been separated into Series III.</p>
                    <p>Among the better known correspondents are Benjamin Franklin, the Earl of Shelburne, Joseph Priestley, Thomas Jefferson, and Parker Cleaveland.</p>

                    <p>Manuscript essays and notes on a startling array of topics written by Benjamin Vaughan, arranged alphabetically by title. Topics range from dueling to dysentery, and like his correspondence, touch on nearly every facet of Vaughan's intellectual interests including science (Concerning geology, granite, phlogiston, meteorology), religion (Locke on religion), agriculture (cultivation of hemp, the olive; horses and improving the breed, the making of hay), Maine (Description of Hallowell, hints for settling the interior), international politics (neutrality, Napoleon), and American politics and society (Louisiana purchase, Negroes).</p>
                    <p>Materials relating to politics, medicine, and religion are also located in Series IV.</p>

                    <p>Miscellaneous bound manuscript volumes on various topics kept at Hallowell by Benjamin Vaughan and other members of his family. Among the volumes are a catalog of the books left by Samuel Vaughan, 1823; a cash book and account book kept by Petty Vaughan, 1813-1821 and 1816-1817; and an account book of William Oliver Vaughan, 1818.</p>
                    <p>Seven of the bound volumes bear a more direct relationship to Benjamin Vaughan: a lecture on moral philosophy delivered by John Aikin (1713-1780) at the Warrington Academy, 1767; two notebooks and a chronology of ancient history, 1773-1775, and two volumes of "abridgments of books examined," including comments on Locke, ca.1760s-1779s. The most significant of these is a moral philosophical treatise,
