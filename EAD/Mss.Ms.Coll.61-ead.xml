            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>An applied geographer from Ohio State University, Eugene Van Cleef came to his field by way of an earlier interest in meteorology. Born in Chicago in 1887, Van Cleef received his bachelor's degree in climatology at the University of Chicago in 1908 and spent much of his early career moving between positions in the corporate world and academia. After three years at Rand McNally surveying academic institutions for their interests in wall maps, he taught geography at the State Teachers College in Duluth, Minnesota from 1911-1918. In Duluth, he began to develop the first of his career constants, an interest in Finnish immigrants in the United States, and he began to develop valuable professional contacts in geography. Among the most important colleagues he cultivated at this time was the great geographer Joseph Partsch, with whom Van Cleef studied in Leipzig in 1913-1914.</p>
            <p>During a return to the corporate world after the First World War working for his family's chemical product firm, Van Cleef acquired the second of his career constants: an interest in applying geographical knowledge to commerce and foreign trade. A talk he gave on the topic at the American Meteorological Society in December 1920 earned him an invitation to take a position as assistant professor of geography at Ohio State, where his interest in linking geography and business were well received.</p>
            <p>Throughout his career, Van Cleef promoted the study of geography as an applied physical science, not a social science, and he assiduously sought to orient his research toward practical matters that he believed would benefit the public weal. Focusing initially on the interaction of weather, climate, and society, by the 1920s, Van Cleef's research on the Finns took on an increased momentum. He became active in a variety of humanitarian organizations focused on Finns during the 1930s, and for his efforts, he was awarded the Order of the White Rose, Commander Class II by the Finnish government.</p>
            <p>Convinced of the need for American corporations to improve their knowledge of the world, his department asked Van Cleef to develop a geographical curriculum in international trade. His two books on the subject, 
                <title render="italic">Getting into Foreign Trade</title> (1946) and 
                <title render="italic">Geography for the Business Man</title> (1943), were relatively little read, but were generally useful at increasing interest within the business community in geographical issues. His high school textbook 
                <title render="italic">This Business World</title> (1937; later renamed 
                <title render="italic">Global Geography</title>) was more widely used.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most important area of interest for Van Cleef, however, was urban geography where once again he applied his interests in commerce. Based upon a course he developed in urban geography (the first in the nation), Van Cleef's book 
                <title render="italic">Trade Centers and Trade Routes</title> (1937) found a ready audience in business schools, and the book is credited with introducing the terms 
                <emph render="italic">Umland</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Hinterland</emph> into American geography.</p>
            <p>Van Cleef was honored by the National Council for Geographic Education as recipient of an award for outstanding geographic writing in non-professional journals, and received the annual award from the International Trade Committee for work in foreign trade and was made the first honorary life member of the Ohio Academy of Science. The American Geographical Society's Van Cleef Medal was established in honor of Dr. Van Cleef and his wife, Frieda Miller Van Cleef for outstanding work in urban geography. He died in Columbus on November 7, 1983.</p>

                    <p>Approximately 526 folders of personal and professional correspondence. The personal correspondence is related mostly to friends and relatives, students and colleagues, but includes reactions to all aspects of Van Cleef's work. The larger portion, the professional correspondence, is related to Van Cleef's work in applied geography, and specifically to his interest in education, urban planning, foreign trade, writing, and the Finns and humanitarian matters.</p>
                    <p>The series includes some correspondence relating to Van Cleef's publications, generally listed under the name of the individual correspondent rather than the name of the publisher or institution. The folders are filed alphabetically by the name of the correspondent.</p>
