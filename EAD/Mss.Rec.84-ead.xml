                        <p>This program begins with a description given by researcher of the methods and objectives of the planned recording sessions. From 13:32, the remainder of the program consists of a Hidatsa word list elicited by the reading of English entries in Robert C. Hollow's Mandan dictionary. (See Related Resource.) This program spans pgs. 335-339. Some of the English entries are skipped, and some items are added, primarily at the beginning of the list. The Mandan equivalents from the dictionary are infrequently given. Includes occasional discussion of context and usage of given words, as well as occasional comments on Hidatsa social life and customs. The researcher's voice is often faint throughout the program. The Hidatsa language is referred to on the recording by one of its alternate names, "Gros Ventre." This Gros Ventre is not to be confused with the Atsina language of the same name. This program was originally recorded on the collector's original tape 71, channel 1.</p>

This program covers pgs. 339-347. Some of the English entries are skipped. The Mandan equivalents from the dictionary are infrequently given. Includes occasional discussion of context and usage of given words, as well as occasional comments on Hidatsa social life and customs. There is a section from 01:26:08 - 01:27:22 of significant crackling, inconsistent levels, and intermittent signal loss. When transferred to RDAT tape, the original recording spanned the end of one tape and the beginning of the subsequent one. As a result, there is a small gap in the recording at 01:40:58. Three seconds of silence were inserted to reflect the gap of missing original material, which is of underdetermined length, though likely no more than a few seconds. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The Hidatsa language is referred to on the recording by one of its alternate names, "Gros Ventre." This Gros Ventre is not to be confused with the Atsina language of the same name. This program was originally recorded on the collector's original tape 71, channel 4.</p>

                        <p>This program consists of a Hidatsa word list elicited by the reading of English entries in Robert C. Hollow's Mandan dictionary. (See Related Resource.) This program covers pgs. 378-379. Some of the English entries are skipped. The Mandan equivalents from the dictionary are infrequently given. Includes occasional discussion of context and usage of given words, as well as occasional comments on Hidatsa social life and customs.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This recording session is interrupted at 13:37 by a knock on the door of the consultant's house. This is followed by a conversation in Hidatsa between the consultant and three women requesting his assistance at a funeral. The conversation continues through 19:41. The recording concludes with a discussion in English between the researcher and consultant regarding the Hidatsa conversation. The Hidatsa language is referred to on the recording by one of its alternate names, "Gros Ventre." This Gros Ventre is not to be confused with the Atsina language of the same name. This program was originally recorded on the collector's original tape 72, channel 1.</p>

                        <p>This program consists of elicitations of Hidatsa language information through use of a list of grammatical morphemes given in Robert C. Hollow's Mandan dictionary. Frequent variations and additions to the list are made by the researcher. Includes occasional comments on Hidatsa social life and customs. The program begins with a list of plant and animals names that does not appear to be directly derived as such from the Hollow dictionary. The grammatical morphemes elicitation begins at 00:04:50. The Mandan grammatical morphemes that are worked from in this program are: "collective," "dubitative," "conditional," "patient suffix," "continuative," "locative," "similitive," "times (postposition)," "instrumental case," "mild imperative," "directional," "possessive," "instrumentative," "ordinal," "reflexive," "evidential," "agentive," "instrumental prefix: by striking," "nominal suffix," "imperfective aspect," "quotative mood," "negative imperative proclitic," and "vertitive." The Hidatsa language is referred to on the recording by one of its alternate names, "Gros Ventre." This Gros Ventre is not to be confused with the Atsina language of the same name. This program was originally recorded on the collector's original tape 73, channel 1.</p>

(See Related Resource.) Some of the entries are skipped. The Mandan equivalents from the dictionary are infrequently given. Includes occasional discussion of context and usage of given words, as well as occasional comments on Hidatsa social life and customs.

Includes occasional discussion of context and usage of given words, as well as occasional comments on Hidatsa social life and customs. From 18:15 - 30:29, discussion primarily concerns the meaning of the Hidatsa words for the Mandan people and the Hidatsa people respectively, the Crow people's words for themselves and the Hidatsa people, and the prevalence of the use of these languages and Mandan among each group. Approximately two pages of dictionary entries subsequent to those on this program are not on RDAT tape from which the digitized copies have been made. The researcher's voice is occasionally very faint at times during this program. The Hidatsa language is referred to on the recording by one of its alternate names, "Gros Ventre."

Some of the material is Hidatsa to English, some English to Hidatsa. The elicitations focus on prefixes and suffixes and are based on stories gathered by the researcher in 1939. Includes occasional discussions of details of Hidatsa social life and customs. The Hidatsa language is referred to on the recording by one of its alternate names, "Gros Ventre."

                        <p>In this program the researcher gives English sentences to the consultant, who then gives them back in Hidatsa. The researcher's English sentences are based on definitions of Hidatsa words given in the dictionary section of Washington Matthews' 1877 book, "Ethnography and philology of the Hidatsa Indians." The researcher proceeds through the Hidatsa entries alphabetically and occasionaly skips entries. Interspersed throughout the program are occasional discussions of miscellaneous aspects of Hidatsa social life and customs. The Hidatsa language is referred to on the recording by one of its alternate names, "Gros Ventre." This Gros Ventre is not to be confused with the Atsina language of the same name. This program was originally recorded on the collector's original tape 76, channel 4.</p>

                        <p>Program consists of elicitations of Hidatsa sentences. The researcher's English sentences are based on definitions of Hidatsa words given in the dictionary section of Washington Matthews' 1877 book, "Ethnography and philology of the Hidatsa Indians." The researcher proceeds through the Hidatsa entries alphabetically and occasionaly skips entries. Interspersed throughout the program are occasional discussions of miscellaneous aspects of Hidatsa social life and customs. The Hidatsa language is referred to on the recording by one of its alternate names, "Gros Ventre." This Gros Ventre is not to be confused with the Atsina language of the same name.
