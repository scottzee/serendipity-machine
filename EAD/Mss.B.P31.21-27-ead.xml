            <p>The seven volumes that compose this collection are an assortment of materials that shed light on the life of Coleman Sellers, a prominent Philadelphian engineer and inventor. The volumes are primarily account books. Among them are: a very short “house book” (#21), “family expenses” for 1824, 1825, and 1826 (#22) that records a wide range of purchases, a receipt book that deals with the accounts of Coleman Sellers, often regarding rental income (#23a and b), individual accounts with Coleman Sellers (#24), records of transactions at the First Church of New Jerusalem of Delaware, and bank records for the Schuylkill Bank (#27).</p>
            <p>The Coleman Sellers portion also contains a large letter book. The letter book contains documents that deal almost exclusively with Sellers' business dealings. Aside from the financial dealings of the company, Sellers letters offer insight into early engineering. He often describes parts, machines, and occasional their functioning.</p>
