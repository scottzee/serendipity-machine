            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>The profound influence of the thought of Charles Darwin on contemporary scientific culture stems largely from his theory of natural selection, the first widely accepted mechanism to account for organismal evolutionary change. A product of Victorian preconceptions of the order of nature and the nature of change, both Darwin and his theories have proven remarkably resilient and remain a vital heuristic in the biological sciences.</p>
            <p>The son of the physician Robert Darwin, Charles Darwin was blessed with a pair of illustrious grandfathers from the progressive elite of British Whiggery, the 
                <emph render="italic">savant</emph> and proto-evolutionist, Erasmus Darwin, and the manufacturer of ceramics, Josiah Wedgwood. Born in Shrewsbury on February 12, 1809, Charles entered the University of Edinburgh at age sixteen, intending to follow in his father's footsteps into medicine, but he proved as unmotivated a student as he was unenthusiastic. Repulsed by the experience of attending surgeries undertaken in the absence of anaesthetics, Darwin abandoned his already half-hearted commitment to medicine and in 1827, he left Edinburgh for Christ's College, Cambridge, to study for the ministry.</p>
            <p>The change of venue did little to rouse Darwin's enthusiasm for coursework, however at Cambridge, he met three men whose enthusiasm for nature sparked his imagination. With the great geologist, Charles Lyell, Darwin undertook field excursions to south Wales and was introduced to the concept of uniformitarianism; with F.W. Hope, he spent the summer of 1829 collecting bugs and beetles; while the botanist John Stevens Henslow encouraged his interest in the natural sciences, but equally importantly introduced him to Captain Robert Fitz-Roy. After receiving his degree in 1831, Darwin signed on as naturalist aboard Fitz-Roy's H.M.S. 
                <emph render="italic">Beagle</emph> on its cruise around the world. Summarizing Darwin's subsequent career would be an exercise in courting claims to insufficiency while guaranteeing inadequacy, yet</p>
            <p>Returning home from the 
                <emph render="italic">Beagle</emph> in 1836, Darwin began in earnest to write and publish in natural history. His first paper, speculating on the origin of coral atolls, was begun in December 1835, and he began his first notebook on theories relating to the transmutation of species in July 1837, only two months after presenting his coral atoll paper at the Geological Society. Financial pressures were not a concern for the well-heeled Darwin, particularly after marrying his wealthy first cousin, Emma Wedgwood, in January 1839, and from the late 1830s onward, Darwin was able to lead an gentleman's life devoted to the pursuit of science, interrupted on occasion by illness and family concerns.</p>
            <p>Darwin's first major monograph, his 
                <emph render="italic">Journal of Researches</emph> (London: H. Colburn, 1839), was an important record of the geological and natural historical observations made during his voyage aboard the 
                <emph render="italic">Beagle,</emph> and was a huge popular success. Since his visit to the Galapagos aboard the 
                <emph render="italic">Beagle,</emph> however, Darwin had been percolating with ideas on the transmutation of species, an idea that had concerned his grandfather Erasmus before him. According to Darwin's retelling of the events, his ideas began to gel after reading Thomas Malthus's 
                <emph render="italic">Essay on the Principle of Population,</emph> which confirmed his predilection for viewing nature as a struggle for existence in which "favourable variations would tend to be preserved and unfavourable ones to be destroyed." Malthusian logic, he believed, would lead one to conclude that the end result would be the differential reproduction of animal populations based upon the characteristics each possessed, leading ultimately to speciation. By the early 1840s, Darwinian natural selection was beginning to germinate.</p>
            <p>Yet still he sat. Darwin's research during the 1840s and early 1850s included brushes with the evolutionist thought of the botanist J.D. Hooker, the cosmic Robert Chambers and others, and in 1842, he sketched out the rudiments of his theory, thinking enough of it to have it copied two years later. His ardor for publishing on the topic may have been cooled by the hostility he saw meted out to Chambers' 
                <emph render="italic">Vestiges of the Natural Creation</emph> (1844), but his attention was also divided -- barnacles and migraines were as much part of Darwin's decades as natural selection. Even the appearance in 1855 of Alfred Russel Wallace's "On the Law Which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species" in the 
                <emph render="italic">Annals and Magazine of Natural History</emph> did little to prod Darwin onward, nor did the intervention of his old mentor, Charles Lyell, speed the pen. It was not until 1858 that Darwin moved forward, having receiving a letter from Wallace informing him that Malthus's 
                <emph render="italic">Essay</emph> had illuminated 
                <emph render="italic">his</emph> thinking on the origin of species, and enclosing a manuscript for comment that outlined a theory with a strong, coincidental resemblance to Darwin's own. Fearful of losing any claim to priority, Darwin had his 1844 essay and Wallace's published jointly in the 
                <title render="italic">Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society </title>in August 1858, and he proceeded feverishly (often literally so) to work on a longer "abstract" of his ideas, the work that became his magnum opus, 
                <title render="italic">On the Origin of Species </title>(London: J. Murray, 1859).</p>
            <p>In the spectacular sequence of books that followed, Darwin elucidated various aspects of the theory of natural selection, progressing with increasing confidence through 
                <title render="italic">The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication </title>(London: J.Murray, 1868), 
                <title render="italic">The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex </title>(London: J. Murray, 1871); and 
                <title render="italic">The Expression of the Emotions in Man and the Animals </title>(London: J. Murray, 1872). Lacking, as he admitted, in any coherent theory of heredity, Darwin's natural selection nevertheless provided a persuasive explanation of the mechanics of organismal change. While the response to natural selection was not uniformly warm, perhaps even providing impetus to Lamarckian theories of inheritance, it was chiefly responsible for establishing evolutionary change as an integral part of biological explanation. The broader implications of Darwin's thought, including the role of contingency, relativism, and stochasticity in organismal change continue to define biological interests. More subtly, his ideas catalyzed a slow shift away from typological thinking (imaging the organism with respect to a perfect "type") toward viewing organisms in the context of a population, an attitudinal adjustment with profound implications for the practice of science in the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>Darwin continued with research and writing until the time of his death on April 19, 1882. His last work was the quirky, fascinating, and perhaps prophetic book, 
                <title render="italic">The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms </title>(London: J. Murray 1882).</p>

            <p>The Darwin Papers at the American Philosophical Society represent approximately 15% of the surviving correspondence of the British evolutionary theorist, Charles Darwin.

            <p>The earliest accession of Darwin Papers at the APS consisted of an extensive and important series of letters between Darwin and his colleague and mentor, Charles Lyell, that frame the development of their thought from the late 1830s into the 1870s. There is a wealth of other important correspondence in the collection with John Thomas Gulick, George John Romanes, and Philip Lutley Sclater, among others.</p>
            <p>This collection includes photostats of letters from Walsh to Darwin, in the Chicago Museum of Natural History, and photostats of Darwin manuscripts in possession of Dr. Robert M. Stecher, Cleveland, Ohio.</p>

                <emph render="italic">Relevance of the Darwin Calendar</emph></p>
            <p>Thousands of pages have been written about Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882), whose 
                <title render="italic">Origin of Species</title> laid the foundation for modern evolutionary theory. Even so, our picture of Darwin and our assessment of his place in history are undergoing constant revision. Relatively speaking, we are, after all, only recently accustomed to the notion that we share a common ancestry with apes, and few outside the biological professions yet appreciate the sweeping implications of population thinking (as opposed to typological thinking) or the concept of ecology. The social and political significance of Darwin's work will probably be debated for some time to come. Many historians of science are interested in the processes by which Darwin's ideas were formulated, disseminated, and ultimately accepted by scientists and by laymen. Scientists continue to be enlightened by reading Darwin
                <emph render="super">1</emph> and publication of transcriptions of Darwin's various manuscripts occurs regularly.
                <emph render="super">2</emph></p>
            <p>Given these developments, as well as the added stimulus provided by the 1959 centennial of the publication of the 
                <emph render="italic">Origin,</emph> it seems certain that research and writing upon Darwin will continue, with scholars demanding access to ever more records of Darwin's life and work. This calendar was prepared with this demand in mind, so that readers may better interpret the significance of this great naturalist's achievements and those of his colleagues.</p>
            <p>The five remaining sections of this introduction explain in a general way the design and the intended utility of the calendar. They discuss the following topics: 1)the primary importance of letters in the assessment of Darwin's life and work; 2) the justification for publishing these letters; 3) the nature of the Darwin letters collection at the Library of the American Philosophical Society; 4) the reasons for publishing the letters in the more-or-less unfashionable calendar format; and 5) the unique problems encountered in dating the letters. A rather extensive and detailed statement of the editorial method employed in this calendar follows the introduction.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="italic">Darwin's Letters</emph></p>
            <p>Modern man, armed with the telephone and often inundated with bureaucratic paperwork, might find it hard to comprehend how important letters were to life among the literate elite of the nineteenth century, and how valuable these nineteenth-century letters now are to scholars. But Darwin's contemporaries knew well the value of letters; Thomas Jefferson put the point succinctly in 1823 when he argued that "the letters of a person, especially of one whose business has been chiefly transacted by letters, form the only full and genuine journal of his life."
                <emph render="super">3</emph> This was especially true of scientists and other scholars of the day, for whom communication of the written word was such an integral part of intellectual activity.</p>
            <p>Letters are particularly significant in Darwin's case. Physically isolated at Down House for most of his life and often immobilized by chronic illness, Darwin depended more heavily than others upon letters as his principal mode of communication. Moreover, because correspondence was Darwin's usual medium of contact with his closest friends, his letters often exhibit a degree of candor about his life and work not revealed clearly in any of his other papers and publications -- not even in the intimate 
                <emph render="italic">Autobiography</emph> which, though written for his own satisfaction and the entertainment of his children, lacked the presence of daily communication and was tempered somewhat by the restraints of Darwin's time and class.
                <emph render="super">4</emph></p>
            <p>Finally, the unusually heterogeneous quality of the Darwin letters reveal better than any other of the records of his life the diversity of his daily routine and the catholicity of his interests and preoccupations.</p>
            <p>Scholars who examine the record of Darwin's life contained in his letters can expect to find many types of information. For the historian of science with a bent toward the history of ideas, there is abundant material on Darwin's scientific views. Sometimes a passage in a letter clarifies or corrects a claim in one of Darwin's published works; for example, in a letter to Charles Lyell in 1860, Darwin is tempering a rather extreme contention, which he had written into the 
                <emph render="italic">Origin,</emph> when he writes that "Ammonites have become wholly extinct in a remarkably sudden manner 
                <emph render="italic">relatively</emph> to most other families [and not absolutely, as implied in the 
                <emph render="italic">Origin];</emph> I meant only this [in the 
                <emph render="italic">Origin],</emph> but I see I have not been nearly guarded enough."
                <emph render="super">5</emph> At other times Darwin retracts assertions made in previous letters; in some cases only the earlier, unamended claim has been published, so that the unsuspecting scholar may be misled if he does not peruse carefully the unpublished materials.
                <emph render="super">6</emph></p>
            <p>Occasionally, a Darwin letter will contain opinions and theories not yet expressed in print, or at least not yet expressed as well as in the particular unpublished letter at hand; writing to Lyell in 1860, for example, Darwin argued that "how far to lump &amp; split species is indeed a hopeless problem. It must in the end, I think, be determined by mere convenience."
                <emph render="super">7</emph> It would be hard to locate a more succinct or more modern expression of Darwin's well-known disbelief in the existence of identifiable species.</p>
            <p>Scholars interested in the social history of science, the growth of scientific ideas, the sociology of science, and the dynamics of scientific communities also will find much of interest in the letters, for they contain many of Darwin's views on these subjects, especially in reference to Darwin's assessment of the prospects for ultimate acceptance of his own theories. This is best exemplified in Darwin's confidences to friends in 1859 and 1860 regarding the fate of the 
                <emph render="italic">Origin,</emph>
                <emph render="super">8</emph> but there are other examples concerning Darwin's views about priority and his estimation of the role his cirripede work would play in the growth of science.
                <emph render="super">9</emph></p>
            <p>Still another revealing type of information expressed only in the letters is that relating to Darwin's assessments of his colleagues -- enlightening glimpses of Darwin's critical insight at work which rarely surfaced in the polite society of contemporary England but are now absolutely necessary for a full understanding of his professional identity and behavior. Where else can one find Darwin saying of Robert FitzRoy: "I never cease wondering at his character,... full of good... traits but spoiled by such an unlucky temper. Some part of... his brain wants mending....?"
                <emph render="super">10</emph>. It is no wonder that this passage, as well as one which describes Richard Owen as "wonderfully clever in his malevolence,"
                <emph render="super">11</emph> usually were deleted silently from the earlier published versions of Darwin's letters -- this is all the more reason for including them here.</p>
            <p>To complement such insights and revelations, there is much autobiographical matter in the letters. It might be used to construct a reasonably good record both of Darwin's face-to-face encounters with his colleagues and of the content of such meetings.
                <emph render="super">12</emph> Often the letters record Darwin's whereabouts, which information is especially useful in determining the dates of Darwin's frequent one-day trips into London -- something not systematically recorded elsewhere.
                <emph render="super">13</emph> Moreover, the letters constantly remind us that Darwin was as much a family man and a medical patient as he was a naturalist and a scientist, and they show how these different aspects of Darwin's life tended to interact. For example, in 1860, Darwin's daughter contracted remittent fever, and the family was forced by their concern for the young girl's life to remove to a healthier climate than that found at Down. While thus away, Darwin found himself unable to continue the research he had been conducting at home, so he filled his idle time by examining the sun-dew, an insectivorous plant common to the area being visited. This work eventually led to the publication of an entire book on insectivorous plants, and one could therefore argue the extreme externalist position that illness had been the cause for its appearance.
                <emph render="super">14</emph></p>
            <p>Still another type of correspondence consists of purely business letters, which range from orders and acknowledgments of books and reprints -- data valuable to scholars -- to routine details such as the addition of a wing to Down House in 1876-1877 or the purchase of medical supplies.
                <emph render="super">15</emph> Such routine letters show, if nothing else, Darwin's meticulousness, and they are sometimes useful for dating other Darwin letters of greater import.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="italic">Need to Publish Letters</emph></p>
            <p>To a certain extent, scholars have been reaping benefits from Darwin's letters for long time, since the bulk of Darwin's most important letters have been in print for well over fifty years, and additional letters have been published from time to time ever since.
                <emph render="super">16</emph> One might well ask, then, why a calendar of 700 more letters is necessary, especially since portions, at least, of roughly half of the letters in the American Philosophical Society's collection have already been printed. Several different responses can be given to this question.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, there is the problem of selection criteria in the major published collections of Darwin's correspondence. The three works which contain published versions of many of the items calendared below (as well as a great many other Darwin letters) provide only a selection of Darwin's correspondence, and those letters which are included are usually not transcribed in full. In all three of these works, the choice of both which letters are to be included and which portions of the chosen letters are to be printed has been colored by the motives of the editors. As these motives are not those of historians today, there are limitations -- some of them severe -- to the usefulness of these works as definitive references for modern scholars. To illustrate the point: "In choosing letters for publication," says Darwin's son Francis in the opening line of the preface of his edition of his father's 
                <emph render="italic">Life and Letters, "</emph>I have been largely guided by the wish to illustrate my father's personal character." In some cases, such guidance led him to give a relatively low priority to the illustration of Darwin's scientific work, and in most cases, it meant deleting family matters as well as derogatory remarks and other embarrassing details.
                <emph render="super">17</emph>
                <emph render="italic">More Letters,</emph> edited by Francis Darwin and A. C. Seward, somewhat redresses the balance; its editors say that they prepared the volumes "to give as full an idea as possible of the course of Mr. Darwin's work," and they state further that their compendium contains "practically all the matter that it now seems desirable to publish. But," they continue, "at some future time others may find interesting data in what remains unprinted; this is certainly true of a short series of letters dealing with the Cirripedes, which are omitted solely for want of space."
                <emph render="super">18</emph> Similarly, in the preface to her two-volume biography of her mother, which contains 66 of her father's letters, Darwin's daughter, H. E. Litchfield, confesses that she began to prepare a record of her mother's life because she thought it would be "of value to her [Emma Darwin's] grandchildren," and then she altered and enlarged the scope of the book as she became interested in "the personalities of the writers" of the letters printed therein.
                <emph render="super">19</emph> While such criteria of inclusion and exclusion were perfectly respectable and common in their day, and scholars have profited greatly from all these works despite their limitations, there is still a need to treat Darwin's letters more systematically, particularly with the needs of historians of science and other scholars in mind.</p>
            <p>A still more serious indictment of the principal sources of Darwin's correspondence is that those letters which do appear in them were not edited according to rigorous modern standards. "In printing the letters," Francis Darwin confesses about the 
                <emph render="italic">Life and Letters, "</emph>I have followed (except in a few cases) the usual plan of indicating the existence of omissions or insertions." One wonders what the "few cases" were, and exactly how few they were. "I have not followed the originals," he continues, "as regards the spelling of names, the use of capital letters, or in the manner of punctuation."
                <emph render="super">20</emph> Similarly, in 
                <emph render="italic">More Letters, "</emph>dots indicate omissions, but many omissions are made without being so indicated."
                <emph render="super">21</emph> In 
                <emph render="italic">Emma Darwin, "</emph>many omissions are made without putting any sign that this has been done. Neither the punctuation nor the spelling has been rigidly followed. But the sense has never 
                <emph render="italic">wittingly</emph> been altered, although occasionally a word

            <p>In addition to the problems relating to the imprecise editorial standards of these works and to standards of letter selection which stress Darwin's character to the neglect of his career and other aspects of his life, some scholars may have difficulty in using these works because: the letters are not placed in chronological order; in far too many cases are incorrectly dated or are not dated at all
                <emph render="super">23</emph>; and the indexes are inadequate.</p>
            <p>To a certain extent, these final criticisms can also be levelled at some of the small selections of Darwin letters published as journal articles with increasing frequency since the centennial of the publication of the 
                <emph render="italic">Origin</emph> in 1859.
                <emph render="super">24</emph> Moreover, the quality of the transcriptions in some of these articles is not very good.
                <emph render="super">25</emph> While this calendar will not rectify all of these problems (most notably because it contains a rather small and arbitrary selection of those letters published in these articles), it should clarify all such problems for the letters with which it deals. Moreover, use of this calendar should at least streamline the kind of research which can be conducted only while one is visiting the Society's archives. This should save much research time.

                <emph render="italic">Nature of the Society's Darwin Collections</emph></p>
            <p>To a first approximation, Darwin's correspondents can be grouped according to their relationship to Darwin and their function as contributors to his work. A look at a few of these various types of correspondent may help readers to obtain an overview of the Darwin collections calendared here.</p>
            <p>Among the correspondents, there are at least six types. 1. Members of the Darwin family. Letters to and from these persons are sometimes the most intimate of all of Darwin's letters, but they are not so numerous as letters to and from some correspondents in the other groups discussed below. This is probably because of Darwin's proximity to his family -- except, of course, during his early life, particularly during the voyage of the 
                <emph render="italic">Beagle,</emph> when letters home to his sister are some of the most revealing letters Darwin ever wrote. 2. Confidants, friends, and close colleagues. These persons were the figures most closely associated with Darwin's everyday work, and the letters to them are the most useful for historians. In some cases, because of Darwin's removal from London and need to keep in close touch with his most trusted colleagues, the collected letters to these figures form an almost daily record of Darwin's life and work. 3. Other colleagues. These were scientists, naturalists, and the like with whom Darwin had only professional relations. Although somewhat less cordial than letters to confidants, correspondence with other colleagues is similar in substance to that with confidants. 4. Informants. These were rather special colleagues who supplied the sedentary Darwin with the observations and other data needed to test various aspects of his scientific theories. Darwin was careful in his selection of informants; he always checked to be certain that each one was an expert in the subject about which he was inquiring. Darwin had such informants in all corners of the world, but he also called upon nearby friends, relatives, former schoolmates, and acquaintances for information on topics about which such persons had some knowledge. 5. Business associates. This category includes booksellers, publishers, chemical suppliers, solicitors, architects, and the like. Correspondence with them is sometimes useful as a record of Darwin's activities, especially as an indicator of Darwin's reading, and it usually shows Darwin's attention to detail. 6. Unsolicited correspondents. From such persons Darwin received many letters, notes, and specimens. These ranged from crank mail to information on scientific curiosities about which Darwin showed great interest.</p>
            <p>All six of these groups are represented to a greater or lesser degree in the American Philosophical Society's collections, and since some of the finest examples are not easily identified by perusal of the calendar, given its chronological format, they are discussed below. Unfortunately, they give a necessarily one-sided view of the relationship between Darwin and his correspondents, because there are only eleven letters 
                <emph render="italic">to</emph> Darwin in the Society's collections.
                <emph render="super">27</emph></p>
            <p>At the core of the Library's holdings are the letters to Charles Lyell, the father of uniformitarian geology and Darwin's "Lord Chancellor" for science.
                <emph render="super">28</emph> Until his death in 1875, Lyell was one of Darwin's closest confidants. Many of Darwin's letters to him have been published, although most of the passages concerning geology, as well as a few other crucial sentences here and there, have been excised from the printed versions. Some of the unpublished letters are also of importance.</p>
            <p>The calendar lists an unusually rich correspondence with two other confidants: George John Romanes, the physiologist, and John Maurice Herbert, one of Darwin's schoolmates at Cambridge. Begun in 1874, the Darwin-Romanes correspondence warmed over time, as Darwin came to trust and admire this young colleague. In a sense, Romanes filled a gap for Darwin which was created with the death of Lyell in 1875, although in the Darwin-Romanes relationship the roles of elder and follower were reversed for Darwin from what they had been with Lyell. The letters to Romanes are replete with details about Darwin's pangenesis hypothesis and the experiments designed by the two men to test it, as well as much material on animal intelligence, spiritualism, and other topics. The letters to Herbert begin as early as 1828 and provide important insight into Darwin's early life, including his voyage on the 
                <emph render="italic">Beagle.</emph> While some of these letters have been published, a few significant portions of them have not, and readers with a particular interest in the views of the young Darwin will probably want to study the Herbert entries in the calendar with extra care.
                <emph render="super">29</emph></p>
            <p>Informants are almost as well represented in the calendar as are confidants. The Library has a particularly good collection of letters to George Henry Kendrick Thwaites, the Ceylonese naturalist, concerning the flora and fauna of Ceylon and India as well as the expression of the emotions of savages in these regions. The collection illustrates well both the questions Darwin asked and the answers he expected to receive. The correspondence with Thomas Campbell Eyton, another of Darwin's schoolmates at Cambridge, is of similar interest, especially on topics relating to osteology and other morphological similarities, dispersal mechanisms, and domestic varieties. Both the Thwaites and the Eyton letters are indicative of the methods of gathering data used extensively by Darwin during and after the 
                <emph render="italic">Origin</emph> period (ca. 1854-1875); the earlier part of these years, of course, represent Darwin's most important fact-gathering episode since his return from the 
                <emph render="italic">Beagle</emph> voyage.</p>
            <p>The collections of letters to the correspondents named above by no means comprise all of the Library's Darwin holdings, of course. There are a great many other letters, sometimes in groups to a single correspondent (e.g. to Philip Lutley Sclater or to John Phillips) and sometimes scattered through miscellaneous correspondence. Only careful reading of all the letters in a given period will give scholars a genuine feel for the totality of Darwin's life and work.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="italic">Choosing the Calendar Format</emph></p>
            <p>In choosing the calendar format for this guide, the primary objective has been to bring scholar and documents as close together as possible, given the restraints of economy, of time, and of the unique character of the originals. Almost thirty years ago, the usefulness of a calendar for achieving this objective in situations such as exist with the Darwin letters at the Society was summed up well by archivist and local historian Morris L. Radoff of the Maryland Hall of Records:</p>
            <p/>
            <p/>
            <p>This calendar is somewhat more extensive than most. A description of this more extensive type of reference work and a justification for its employment in this instance are summed up well in the 
                <emph render="italic">Harvard Guide to American History:</emph></p>
            <p/>
            <p/>
            <p>
                <emph render="italic">Resolving the Dating Problem</emph></p>
            <p>Anyone who has worked with Darwin's letters knows how difficult it often is to assign a correct and exact date to each of his letters. Francis Darwin and A. C. Seward stated the problem well when they wrote that "Mr. Darwin, who was careful in other things, generally omitted the date in familiar correspondence, and it is often only by treating a letter as a detective studies a crime that we can make sure of its date."
                <emph render="super">32</emph> For a compiler of a calender of Darwin's letters, of course, the inconsistent dating creates the same problems and puzzles that Francis Darwin faced, and, like him, one has to employ a variety of methods of dating that would do honor to Sherlock Holmes. The usual techniques involving watermarks, postmarks, content analysis, and handwriting analysis were sufficient in most cases, but even after such methods had been employed the dates on a number of letters remained ambiguous.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, study of the variant addresses appearing in the headings of almost all Darwin letters written since 1842 has allowed the dating of most of the letters in the calendar, at least to within a few years.
                <emph render="super">33</emph> The research on this subject, conducted in collaboration with Thaddeus J. Trenn, University of Regensburg, indicates that Darwin used at least nine variant letterhead addresses for his home in Down as tabulated in the table below and illustrated in Figure 2.</p>

            <p>(The end points for these dates were determined by recording the addresses and the dates for all unambiguously-dated Darwin letters which could be found, both here and at Cambridge University Library -- probably about 1,000 letters in all. A plausible explanation apparently can be advanced for every change of address, and in most cases, the switch from one address type to another is sudden. For the purposes of dating the letters in this calendar, however, the greatest possible latitude in the beginning and final dates of use of each variant has been assumed; this has produced the overlaps in the time periods given above. The research on the variant addresses continues, and the final results will probably be published elsewhere.)</p>
            <p>One final note about dates is necessary. Often the date assigned to a particular letter in this calendar will differ by a few days from the date given in a published version of the same letter, especially those published versions appearing in 
                <emph render="italic">Life and Letters</emph> or 
                <emph render="italic">More Letters.</emph> This is because the editors of these works often used the date of receipt of a letter, taken from the endorsement, rather than the actual date on which the letter was written.
                <emph render="super">34</emph> In cases in which Darwin gave some reference to the day of the week on which the letter was written, it has been possible to determine the date of writing by reference to a perpetual calendar. In such cases, the correction of the date has been made silently.</p>
            <p>Purists might not find this calender to their liking. It deviates from traditional practices
                <emph render="super">35</emph> in a number of details, from the distinctive overall format of each of its entries to an unusually liberal use of brackets and inverted commas. These innovations have been dictated by the uncommonly uniform nature of the items analyzed (almost all of them letters written by Darwin), by the peculiar characteristics of Darwin's letters, and by the unique needs of Darwin scholars. In the case of each uncommon procedure, a conscious determination was made that the benefits to be derived by departure from standard practice outweigh the perils and bother incumbent upon readers who must first school themselves in so many unorthodoxies.</p>
            <p>Rules followed and usages observed are explained below, in five sections: format of entries -- an extended guide to most of the practices followed; editorial conventions (i.e. treatment of orthography, punctuation, obsolete grammar, and the like in quoted passages); textual devices; descriptive abbreviations of items (e.g. ALS); and printing conventions. The first section, on format, explains what material is discussed in the four sections that follow it. Illustrations of sample manuscript letters are provided (Figs. 3 and 4), so that users may see for themselves how various situations were treated editorially.</p>
            <p>The calendar consists of a series of entries numbered consecutively in the left-hand margin. Except where noted, each entry represents one letter or other manuscript item, plus all accompanying enclosures, sketches, and the like. Unless indicated otherwise, all enclosures are in Darwin's hand, unsigned, and on approximately the same size and type of paper as the letters with which they are enclosed. Each entry consists of four parts: date; description of item(s); abstract, including publication information, if any; and annotations, if any. Each section is separated from the others by a blank line; otherwise, the entries are single space.</p>
            <p>Arrangement of the parts of the entry in this way was decided upon to facilitate special treatment of certain unique aspects of the Darwin materials. Although the date of an entry is usually placed in the margin in other calendars, it has been given its own line in this calendar so that endorsements, postmarks, and watermarks could be included in full; scholars long accustomed to undated or ambiguously-dated Darwin letters will find this feature useful for checking the dates assigned to undated or incompletely dated letters. The part consisting of the date always contains the year, month, day, and (if provided by Darwin) the day of the week, in that order, on which the letter was written, followed by endorsements, postmarks, watermarks, and other information pertaining to date; such additional dating aids are always given as nearly exactly as possible to how they were on the original, and they are preceded by abbreviations identifying each (e.g. "wmk." precedes the watermark). Editorial conventions and textual devices used with the date are discussed below in two special sections on such matters.</p>
            <p>The description, comprising the second part of each entry, is in two sections. The first section gives, as a first element, the full name of the other principal for the item besides Darwin, and it indicates whether this person is the author or the recipient of the item. This first element would thus read "To Charles LYELL" for a letter from Darwin to Lyell. Note that the last name of the principal is given entirely in upper case letters to facilitate scanning of the entries. (This is only done for individuals.) The second element of the first section of the description provides Darwin's address at the time of writing, as indicated by Darwin himself at the head of each letter. If the address is one of the variants of Darwin's Down address, it will be given as "Down", followed by an indication of the number of the variant type that appears (see p. xxiii, above). Thus, if Darwin wrote "Down Bromley Kent" on a given letter, for example, this will be indicated by "Down (type 2)". If Darwin's whereabouts are not indicated, this will be signified by "no location". If the stationery used has a black mourning border, or if an ink of a distinctive color was used by the author in the writing of the letter, this will be noted in parentheses following the indication of Darwin's location. The two elements of the first section are separated from each other by a semicolon.</p>
            <p>The second section of the description begins a new line below the first section. It consists of three parts: the descriptive abbreviation for the item (e.g. ALS); the dimensions of the item, in inches, with vertical dimension given first
                <emph render="super">36</emph>; and the number of pages of text, rounded up to the nearest whole number of pages. Descriptive abbreviations used are discussed in a separate section below. If there is an envelope, enclosure, or sketch, or if there is an address for, or an endorsement by, the recipient, this will be indicated following the number of pages. If the text of the letter indicates that there should be an enclosure, but there is none, this will be indicated by the phrase "(enclosure wanting)" following the number of pages. If the address for or the endorsement by the recipient 
                <emph render="italic">occupies a separate page</emph> from the pages of text, indication of such address or endorsement will be separated from indication of the number of pages by "and". If such address and/or endorsement is written 
                <emph render="italic">on the same page</emph> as a page of text, indication of such address or endorsement will be separated from indication of the number of pages by a comma. Thus, if a four-page letter, for example, has an endorsement on the top of the first page, above the text, it will be indicated "4p., end."; if the endorsement is on a separate, fifth page, it will be indicated "4p. and end." In other words, readers should always assume that the use of a comma in this instance means that the additional portion of the item is substantively, but not physically, distinct from what precedes the comma; use of the word "and" instead of a comma means that the additional portion is both substantively 
                <emph render="italic">and</emph> physically distinct.</p>
            <p>When there is either an address for Darwin's correspondent or an endorsement, it is reproduced fully in brackets following the indication of its existence. As there is such a large number of misspellings in these addresses and endorsements, 
                <emph render="italic">"sic"</emph> was not employed to indicate them. Readers may assume a misspelling to have been made by Darwin or his correspondent. No attempt was made to identify with certainty the handwriting of endorsements, although those endorsements provided in the calendar are usually in the hands of Darwin's correspondents. As in the case of the date for each item, editorial conventions and textual devices used in the descriptive part of each entry are discussed below in the special sections on such matters.</p>
            <p>The third part of each entry contains the abstract -- the real meat of the item. Radoff claims that "the question of how full the abstract should be has long been the 
                <emph render="italic">bC*te noire</emph> of calendarers,"
                <emph render="super">37</emph> and no statement about calendaring could be truer. After much consideration, reasonably full abstracts were deemed desirable, but a price -- namely the deletion of all textual matter which is published faithfully elsewhere and the rendering of the remaining textual matter in a complex way which is not exceptionally easy to read -- had to be paid for this comprehensiveness, so that the length of the calendar would not be prohibitive. Accordingly, if it is known that the item or any part of it has been published, a simple reference to the location of the printed text will be made in lieu of an abstract of this portion of text. As the completeness and the accuracy of such printed texts varies considerably, however, a series of standardized phrases are employed in the references to the locations of the printed texts, and substantive corrections are supplied. These standardized phrases -- arbitrarily designated as "printing conventions" -- are designed to convey a rough idea of the accuracy and the completeness of the printed texts; they are discussed below in a special section. The substantive corrections -- including abstracts of substantive deleted portions -- follow reference to the location of the printed text. Corrections are keyed into the printed text by reference to the page and line of printed text being corrected. If necessary to avoid ambiguity, the exact location within the given line also is provided. When there is other material on the same printed page as a letter which is being corrected, and a correction is indicated for, say, line 15, the reader should begin counting lines only where the text of the incorrect letter begins: in other words, in this case "line 15" means "line 15 of the letter being corrected," not "line 15 from the top of the page."</p>
            <p>If no published version of any part of the item is known, an abstract of the entire text is provided. The abstracts treat every topic in the original texts; topics are usually (but not always) presented in the order in which Darwin presented them. Each abstract consists of a series of statements (not necessarily whole sentences) connected by semicolons. When a clause begins with a singular indicative verb (e.g. "asks") and no subject of the verb is given, Darwin is implied as the subject. When the verb is not singular and indicative (e.g. "ask"), it should be read as a command to the recipient. Substantial quotation is employed. Superscript arabic numerals in this and the preceding parts of each entry indicate substantial editorial additions and refer to the correspondingly numbered notes in the fourth part of the entry. Other editorial conventions and textual devices employed in this part of each entry are discussed below in special sections.</p>
            <p>The fourth and final part of each entry consists of annotations to the preceding three parts. An effort was made to identify every reference to persons, places, things, publications, and events; if any of these is not identified clearly in an entry, the reader can assume that research upon it proved unsuccessful. Annotations contain the minimum of explanation or interpretation, for this is not the responsibility of an editor; primary objectives of the calendar annotations were identification and description.</p>
            <p>Biographical information is not provided in the annotations to each entry, as this would have necessitated a great many biographical notes for each person, one for each entry in which he or she is mentioned. Instead, biographical information is provided in the biographical notes following the calendar.</p>
            <p>Numbering of the annotations begins afresh for each entry. Sometimes one note (usually the first one) relates to more than one location in the entry, usually because a single annotation can explain how both the date and the recipient of the item were determined in the absence of explicit information in the original. To save space, and to avoid an excessive number of annotations, certain information such as Christian names and titles of books are provided in the abstract rather than in the notes wherever this information can be worked into the abstract reasonably smoothly. Use of the word "perhaps" in a note indicates that the material in the note is conjectural.</p>
            <p>To some degree, the letters annotate each other, since there is often a run of letters on the same subject. Cross-references between two or more letters in which the same subject is discussed are kept to a minimum. Generally, those letters which are obviously part of a series of exchanges between Darwin and a given correspondent on some 
                <emph render="italic">particular</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">very definite</emph> topic are referred only to the 
                <emph render="italic">next earlier letter</emph> on the same topic. This allows readers to trace an exchange on a given topic backwards through time, once the last letter of the series is found.</p>
            <p>Should readers wish at this time to see an example of the layout of the four parts of each entry, a good letter for study is that to Lyell dated August 25, [1845]; its entry is on page 18 below, and the first page of the manuscript letter is reproduced as Figure 3. This letter not only provides an example of the four parts of each entry but also allows readers to compare a typical calendar abstract against the original manuscript, thereby getting some notion of the thoroughness and reliability of the abstracts.</p>
            <p>Additional discussions of minutiae of editorial policy appear at the head of the list of acronyms, abbreviations, and short titles given below, as well as at the head of the biographical notes following the calendar. Finally, in those few locations where editorial additions might easily be interpreted as part of the original item, the initials of the editor ("PTC") have been added to identify the material as editorially added.</p>
            <p>A calendar, unlike a letterpress edition, provides comprehensive faithfulness to the original manuscript only in certain portions of each entry. This imposes upon the calendarer the additional preliminary editorial chore of indicating precisely which parts of each entry are direct quotations from the original and which are not. In this calendar, an attempt has been made to preserve in each entry as much as possible of the original manuscript.</p>
            <p>Subject to the editorial conventions to be outlined below, the following portions of each entry are to be considered as exact transcriptions from the original Darwin letter: the date (i.e. the first part of the entry), including watermarks, postmarks, and endorsements; the name of Darwin's correspondent (i.e. the first element of the first section of the description); Darwin's address (i.e. the second element of the first section of the description), except where the address was a variant Down address, in which case the shorthand form described earlier is used; the endorsement and the address of Darwin's correspondent, if these are provided in the original; those portions of the abstract which are enclosed in inverted commas (hereafter referred to as "quoted portions"); and the factual data (dates, names, titles of books, etc.) in those portions of the abstract 
                <emph render="italic">not</emph> enclosed in inverted commas (i.e. "unquoted portions"). Only the earliest decipherable postmark is provided, and only that portion of a watermark indicating the date is given.</p>
            <p>In each of these exactly-transcribed locations -- with the exception of addresses, endorsements, postmarks, and watermarks, which are discussed below -- the following rules apply: if the word, phrase, or clause is doubtful, the passage in doubt is enclosed in brackets and 
                <emph render="italic">followed</emph> by a question mark ("?"). When more than one reading is plausible, the several readings are all enclosed in a single set of brackets, and each reading is followed by its own question mark (e.g. "[these? those?]"). Editorial additions are enclosed in brackets 
                <emph render="italic">without</emph> a question mark. If the editorial addition is conjectural, it will be enclosed in brackets and preceded by a question mark. Deletions from the text are denoted by ellipsis points ("..."). Passages in parentheses are parenthetical matter from the original. See the section of textual devices below for a graphic representation of these rules.</p>
            <p>Exception to these rules must be made in the case of addresses, endorsements, postmarks, and watermarks because, although they are faithful transcriptions of the original manuscript, these elements are always enclosed within brackets, as a matter of course, in order to set them off from contiguous matter of a different nature. To be specific, watermarks and postmarks are given with the date provided by Darwin; they are enclosed in brackets to prevent their being confused with the date which Darwin himself wrote. Similarly, addresses and endorsements are inserted as part of the description of the item; they are bracketed to set them off from this descriptive matter, the latter having been added editorially. In these special cases, matter in 
                <emph render="italic">parentheses</emph> consists of either portions which are added by the calendarer, are dubious readings, or are found in parentheses in the original; which of these alternatives applies in each case is either clear from the context or is explained by a note.
                <emph render="super">38</emph> Also, in these places where the bracket rules are exceptional, deletions are still denoted by ellipsis points and question marks preceding and following passages have the same meaning as in other locations. In the address for and the endorsement by Darwin's correspondent, as well as in the postmark, transition from one line of manuscript to the next is indicated by the slash ("/"); these transitions are not noted in any other portion of each entry.</p>
            <p>In 
                <emph render="italic">all</emph> locations, titles of office, such as "Mr.", "Mrs.", "Capt.", or Sir", are omitted except in cases in which Darwin gave such titles in the original and the title is or may be important in identifying the person to whom it refers. Also, occasionally a title of office (esp. titles of rank or royalty such as "Captain", "Colonel", or "Lady") will be retained to set endpoints for an otherwise undated letter by reference to the years during which the person had the title. (This only works, of course, if the person in question was elevated to a higher rank at a later time; otherwise, one might keep the same title for life.)</p>
            <p>Names of persons are given fully enough in each location in which they appear so that a positive identification can be made. Those parts of the full name not provided by Darwin are, of course, enclosed in brackets. Sometimes, when necessary to distinguish between two persons with the same name (e.g. father and son), a title of honor or other distinguishing appellation will be annexed in brackets to the name, even if the title had not been conferred at the time the letter was written. An example of such an anachronistic usage is the addition of "Baron Avebury" to the name of John William Lubbock the younger (1834-1913) whenever it appears in letters written before he became a baron. Another anachronistic practice is the inclusion of a woman's married name before the date of her marriage (e.g. "Henrietta Emma Darwin Litchfield" before her marriage to Litchfield). In the case of multiple appearances of the same person's name in a single letter, the full name will be given only at the first encounter; succeeding references will be to surname only.</p>
            <p>In the quoted portions of the abstract, Darwin's marginal notes, postscripts, stray marks, and marginal additions are inserted into the text of the letter without comment if the proper and precise location for them in the text has been indicated by Darwin and is readily identifiable. Otherwise, editorial comments describe roughly where such passages appear in the manuscript. In contrast, extraneous marks made by unknown third parties or by autograph dealers, or numbers and names written by Francis Darwin as part of his compilation scheme for 
                <emph render="italic">Life and Letters</emph> (e.g. the "Denny 5" at the top of Fig. 2a) are not recorded.
                <emph render="super">39</emph> In some cases, deciding whether a stray mark was an endorsement or an extraneous mark of some later handler was very difficult, and a subjective decision had to be made; at all times, an effort was made to be as systematic as possible.</p>
            <p>Darwin's cancellations (i.e. strike-outs) generally are omitted silently from the quoted portions, since they are usually trivial. In those few cases where a cancellation is retained, it is enclosed in brackets with an editorial comment indicating that it is a cancellation. Passages inserted between lines by Darwin are inserted silently into the text whenever Darwin indicated that they should be inserted.</p>
            <p>The original punctuation, grammar, capitalization, and orthography are retained in all passages which are transcribed exactly from the original, with the following exceptions. Superfluous dashes at the close of sentences are usually deleted silently, although a few are kept to retain the Victorian flavor. Colons at the ends of abbreviations are changed to periods. Raised or superscript letters, such as were often found at the ends of abbreviations in nineteenth century correspondence, are silently lowered. Ligatures are silently expanded to two letters, and the elongated "s" is modernized silently. The ampersand ("&amp;") and forms based upon it, such as "&amp;c." for "et cetera", are retained. Other abbreviations in the original are usually expanded, with the added portions enclosed in brackets; in such cases of expansion, the period at the end of the abbreviation is silently deleted.</p>
            <p>These few rules help keep the quoted portions as close to the original as is reasonably possible. The reason for such excessive faithfulness to the manuscript is that, since Darwin's penmanship is so poor, a great amount of deviation from the original might make it difficult for scholars unfamiliar with Darwin's hand to trace back from the choppy text of the abstract to either the original manuscript or a facsimile of it.
                <emph render="super">40</emph> Such difficulty would be compounded, of course, if the scholar could see only a photocopy or microfilm, since -- unavoidably -- such facsimiles are often somewhat less readable than the already difficult manuscript. In some cases, however, such meticulous faithfulness to the original forces deviations from standard practices (e.g. titles of books not underlined). These are allowed to stand without comment where their meaning is not ambiguous; if there is any question as to Darwin's meaning (e.g. if the word "Origin" may or may not refer to the 
                <emph render="italic">Origin of Species),</emph> any information which could be found to resolve the ambiguity is added in brackets or in a note.</p>
            <p>Regarding unquoted portions of the abstract, the original phraseology of the item is often employed without comment, in an effort to minimize the distortion that inevitably results from summarization. In such unquoted portions, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization are modernized and converted to American forms.</p>
            <p>Examples of the application of many of these editorial conventions can be observed by comparison of the following three versions of the letter from Darwin to Lyell, Friday, [June 25, 1858]: 1) the calendar entry, page 56; 2) the first five pages of manuscript for this letter, reproduced as Figure 4; and 3) the printed text on pages 117-18 of volume 2 of 
                <emph render="italic">Life and Letters.</emph> This will show the relative thoroughness with which a printed text has been corrected in the abstract, the relative faithfulness with which the quoted portions of the abstract follow the original text, and the relative amount of condensation which occurs when passages of the original are reduced to unquoted portions of the abstract.</p>

            <p>Since many of the letters in the calendar have been published in whole or in part, and since both the completeness and the accuracy of these printed versions vary considerably, the following conventional phrases have been employed to indicate roughly how well the printed versions resemble the original letters. The conventions were devised so that -- in the absence of contrary indications -- the reader may assume that only a part of the item being calendared has been printed. The reader may further assume that no alterations of the original text have been made in the printed version; if, on the other hand, alterations 
                <emph render="italic">are</emph> indicated, the reader may assume that these changes are of a serious nature, unless a contrary indication is provided.

            <p>Descriptive abbreviations always indicate three things: the type of document being calendared; whether or not the document is in the hand of the author of the document; and the presence or absence of the author's signature. Sometimes they also give additional information, such as indication that the signature is in the form of initials only. These abbreviations are more-or-less standardized among archivists, and they are discussed elsewhere in considerable detail, so only a brief explanation of them is provided below.

            <p>These basic forms can be combined to form composite abbreviations which describe the item being calendared. It would be foolish to list all the possible permutations of the basic forms here, especially since the many possible composite abbreviations can be suggested well by a few examples, such as the following: "ALS" indicates a holograph letter signed by the author; "LS" indicates a letter signed by the author but written in the hand of an amanuensis; "AN on p.c., S by init." indicates a holograph note written on a postal card and initialed, but not signed in full, by the author. The other possible combinations should follow logically from these examples, especially if readers keep in mind the following rule of thumb: assume that the author or composer of the item had nothing to do with the actual writing of the item unless indicated otherwise.</p>

            <p>Abbreviations of periodical titles not listed below may be found in the 
                <emph render="italic">World List of Scientific Periodicals,</emph> 1900-1960, fourth edition. Abbreviations of titles not found in the 
                <emph render="italic">World List</emph> were derived by the editor by using the system of abbreviation described in the 
                <emph render="italic">World List;</emph> the resultant abbreviated titles are listed below. This rather unorthodox approach to abbreviating periodicals in an American publication (i.e. using an English source for abbreviations rather than, say, the 
                <emph render="italic">Union List of Serials)</emph> was employed because the 
                <emph render="italic">World List,</emph> unlike other sources, includes many of the more obscure titles cited by Darwin, and also because the 
                <emph render="italic">World List</emph> abbreviations seem to the author to be the most systematic, consistent, and understandable of any yet devised.</p>
            <p>With exceptions noted below, Darwin titles are shortened to the forms used as headings in Part 2 of R.B. Freeman, 
                <emph render="italic">The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist,</emph> [first edition] (London: Dawsons of Pall Mall, 1965). For each Darwin work cited, the short title and the year of publication only are given, except in cases in which more than one issue of that title appear in the given year; in such cases, the number of the issue used, as found in the Freeman 
                <emph render="italic">Handlist,</emph> is also provided. In places where only the short title and the year appear, and Freeman indicates that more than one issue of that title appeared in that year, the reader may assume that what is said applies to all of these issues or variants.</p>
            <p>Common abbreviations, such as "univ." for "university", are omitted, of course.</p>

                <emph render="super">5</emph> Darwin to Lyell, Sept. 12, [1860], APS; see below, p. 85. (This and other examples of Darwin's letters used in the introduction are selected from 
                <emph render="italic">unpublished</emph> portions of letters now in the American Philosophical Society; they illustrate the wealth of material edited out of previously published versions of Darwin's letters.) The passage on Ammonites which is being corrected is in Darwin, 
                <emph render="italic">Origin</emph> (1859 
                <emph render="italic">or</emph> 1860), 321-22; according to Peckham, 
                <emph render="italic">Variorum Origin,</emph> 531-32, lines 78-83, Darwin never brought his published claim regarding Ammonites into agreement with the admissions made to Lyell in this letter.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="super">6</emph> For example, in a letter to Lyell dated November 18, 1849, and printed in 
                <emph render="italic">More Letters,</emph> II, 130-31, letter 486, Darwin wrote that "without most distinct evidence I will never admit that a 
                <emph render="italic">dike</emph> joins on rectangularly to a stream of lava." Sixteen days later, in a letter dated December 4, he retreated somewhat from this position: "I remember in my last letter talking very big about dikes never being connected directly (i.e. rectangularly) with lava-streams; but it is clear that such occur frequently at the Sandwich Is[lan]ds without any cones." Although he continues by claiming that the situation at the Sandwich Islands [i.e. Hawaii] is "a rare exceptional case", Darwin clearly is amending his earlier claim. The December 4 letter has not been published before. See below, pp. 32-34.</p>

            <p>
                <emph render="super">8</emph> Just after the 
                <emph render="italic">Origin</emph> was published, during the period when reviews of the book began to appear, Darwin told Asa Gray, "I have made up my mind to be well abused; but I think it of importance that my notions sh[oul]d be read by intelligent men, accustomed to scientific argument though 
                <emph render="italic">not</emph> naturalists. It may seem absurd, but I think such men will drag after them those naturalists, who have too firmly fixed in their heads that a species is an entity." (Darwin to Asa Gray, December 21, [1859], Gray Herbarium, Harvard University; printed in 
                <emph render="italic">Life and Letters</emph> II, 244-45; text above from manuscript letter.) In this passage, Darwin implied that his evolutionary "notions" were revolutionary in nature, at least among naturalists, and that he expected his supporters to come from 
                <emph render="italic">outside</emph> the community of naturalists. How important a role he foresaw for these supporters is revealed four months later in his remark to Lyell that "the non-comittal [
                <emph render="italic">sic]</emph> men do not always most help a science." (Darwin to Lyell, April 27/28, [1860], APS, see below, p. 76.) Darwin reiterates this view and identifies some of his supporters in May when he writes to Lyell: "I can very plainly see, as I lately told [Joseph Dalton] Hooker, that my Book would have been &amp; [would] be a mere flash in the pan, were it not for you, Hooker &amp; a few others." (Darwin to Lyell, May 18, [1860], APS, see below, p. 78.) A month later-ironically on the eve of the historic Oxford meeting of the B.A.A.S. at which the 
                <emph render="italic">Origin</emph> was debated so hotly-Darwin despaired of the rapid conversion of naturalists through the intercession of supporters, arguing instead that "time alone will bring naturalists round, when they find that they can explain many facts on such views as mine, &amp; cannot on view of creation." (Darwin to Lyell, [June] 25, [1860], APS, see below, p. 82.) It is almost as if Darwin's practice of population thinking, so well-used on plant and animal species, was being applied to scientific communities; social historians and sociologists of science may find this of some interest, as might some philosophers of science. The foregoing is not meant, of course, to delineate the recent historiography of the social side of Darwin studies; for a stimulating marxist treatment of some aspects of this, see Robert Young, "The Historiographic and Ideological Contexts of the Nineteenth-Century Debate on Man's Place in Nature," in MikulC![scaron] Teich and Robert Young, eds., 
                <emph render="italic">Changing Perspectives in the History of Science: Essays in Honour of Joseph Needham</emph> (London: Heinemann, 1973), 344-438, esp. 361-88.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="super">9</emph> In a confidence to Lyell in 1860, Darwin revealed his views on the role of priority in science, exposing in the process why he apparently never felt completely comfortable publishing simultaneously with Alfred Russel Wallace in 1858. Regarding a reference to Darwin by Asa Gray in one of the later's works, Darwin wrote: "he put my name before [that of Edward] Forbes on Glacial distribution: &amp; I told him in answer that I had written out the notion 3 or 4 years before Forbes, but that I had no sort of claim to notice on this head, as he published first, &amp; that in the Origin I shd. of course take no notice of this." (Darwin to Lyell, [February] 12, [1860], APS, see below, p. 71.) This gives some indication of Darwin's scrupulous professional ethics. On cirripedes, Darwin's expectations regarding the support he would receive for his radical discoveries were far more limited than were his expectations for his work on the origin of species. When Albany Hancock informed Darwin that he believed in Darwin's discovery of complemental males, Darwin replied that he had "greatly feared tha no one would believe in them; and now I know that [Richard] Owen, [James Dwight] Dana, and yourself are believers, I am most heartily content." (Darwin to Hancock, January 10, [1853], as printed in John Hancock, [ed.], "Letters from C. Darwin, Esq., to A. Hancock, Esq.," 
                <emph render="italic">Nat. Hist. Trans. Northumb., 8,</emph> pt. 2 [1886]: 250-78, at 269; original at Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.)</p>

                <emph render="super">10</emph> Darwin to Lyell, August 9, [1838], APS, see below, p. 4. Although Darwin probably was not anticipating it here, FitzRoy committed suicide in 1865.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="super">11</emph> Darwin to Lyell, July 30, [1860], APS, see below, p. 83.)</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="super">12</emph> In 1860, for example, he wrote Lyell: "I have nothing to say, as I have seen no one (except indeed [Joseph Dalton] Hooker for an hour or two at Kew) for an age." (Darwin to Lyell, July 30, [1860], APS, see below, p. 83.) This letter implies that the content of Darwin's meetings with colleagues forms much of the meat of his letters. Still, Darwin exaggerates in his claim that, when he has seen no one, he has nothing to say.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="super">13</emph> For example, we can tell from the letters that Darwin met Lyell in London on February 6, 1845. (Darwin to Lyell, Saturday, [February 8, 1845], APS, see below, pp. 16-17.) Unfortunately, this type of information is sometimes incorrect, either because Darwin would announce a date for a trip to London and then be too ill to travel on the appointed day, which occurred regularly, or because Darwin got his dates mixed up, which occurred very occasionally.</p>

                <emph render="super">14</emph> On his daughter's illness, see letters to Lyell during summer of 1860 (Darwin to Lyell, May 18, [1860], 
                <emph render="italic">et seq.,</emph> APS; see below, p. 78 ff). See especially: Darwin to Lyell, July 30, [1860], APS, see below, p. 83; and 
                <emph render="italic">ibid.,</emph> August 11, [1860], APS, see below, pp. 83-84. The first chapter of Darwin's book on insectivorous plants begins: "During the summer of 1860, I was surprised by finding how large a number of insects were caught by the leaves of the common sun-dew (
                <emph render="italic">Drosera rotundifolia)</emph> on a heath in Sussex. I had heard that insects were thus caught, but knew nothing further on the subject." (Darwin,

                <emph render="super">25</emph> The usual reason for a poor transcription is the inability of the transcriber to read Darwin's handwriting, but still another reason is that thorough editorial standards are usually not employed for the transcription of the small number of letters usually included in these articles.

                <emph render="italic">"Cryptophialus"</emph> in the printed text of a letter to Albany Hancock, December 25, [1849], as printed in John Hancock, [ed.], "Letters from C. Darwin, Esq., to A. Hancock, Esq.,"

The unsuspecting scholar without access to the original letter might conclude from the printed text that by 1849 Darwin had identified his Arthrobalanus specimen as a Cryptophialus; this Darwin had not done-and in fact probably did not do until 1853-and realization of this is central to an understanding of Darwin's cirripede work (Thaddeus J. Trenn, "Charles Darwin, Fossil Cirripedes, and Robert Fitch: Presenting Sixteen Hitherto Unpublished Darwin Letters of 1849 to 1851,"

            <p>
                <emph render="super">27</emph> This unfortunate circumstance results from Darwin's habit of destroying letters received; this practice was not discontinued until 1862, and even after that date Darwin did not save all of his letters.

            <p>Some might also object to the method of production (i.e. photo offset of a carefully-proofed typescript, rather than typeset), but this was necessary to keep the cost per copy down to a level reasonable enough so that scholars could afford personal copies of the calendar.</p>

                <emph render="super">36</emph> Although it is somewhat out of fashion to give the dimensions -- the argument against inclusion being that, given the disparities of different types of handwriting, size is a poor indicator of length of text -- measurements are given in this calendar because of two special factors: 1) most of the letters in the calendar are in Darwin's hand, so there is an uncommonly good relationship between dimensions and length of text; and 2) the dimensions of Darwin's stationery in some cases can be used to corroborate a determination of a date for an undated letter. For example, a claim that an undated letter on stationery measuring eight by five inches was written in, say, 1860, will be corroborated if other Darwin letters known to have been written around this same date also are written on stationery of the same size. This is by no means a hard and fast rule, however; Darwin apparently reverted to leftover scraps and remainders of old stationery on occasion.</p>

            <p>The Library of the American Philosophical Society took its first step toward assembling a collection of manuscripts and books relating to Charles Darwin and evolution in 1950. In that year, at the suggestion of William E. Lingelbach and with the support of Edwin G. Conklin, librarian and president respectively, the Society purchased at auction in London 177 letters from Darwin to Sir Charles Lyell and some 277 more to Lyell from other British and European scientists. Copies of the letters were deposited in the British Museum, and the originals became the nucleus of the Society's Darwin collection. (See Edwin G. Conklin, "Letters of Charles Darwin and Other Scientists and Philosophers to Sir Charles Lyell, Bart.," 
                <title render="italic">Proc. Am. Phil. Soc.</title>, 95 (1951): 220-22.)</p>
            <p>To extend the collection Dr. Lingelbach asked the assistance of Dr. Loren C. Eiseley, who was then writing 
                <emph render="italic">Darwin's Century.</emph> For some years Dr. Eiseley systematically scanned catalogues, made lists of desiderata, and, on visits to booksellers here and in England, purchased books by and about Darwin. Meanwhile the Library continued to acquire letters of Charles Darwin and other 19th century naturalists until it now has almost 700 by Darwin alone.</p>
            <p>In 1973, the preparation of a calendar was begun by the Library in the belief that scholars could use a guide that was something more than a list but short of fully edited transcriptions of the Darwin letters. The work has been supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and it is now published with the approval of Mr. George P. Darwin.</p>
            <p>The calendar was prepared by P. Thomas Carroll. Besides providing concise descriptions of the contents of unpublished letters, Mr. Carroll has indicated when changes were made in published versions, corrected erroneous transcriptions and added notes. A particularly important contribution of this calendar is the method Mr. Carroll and a colleague, Professor Thaddeus Trenn, have devised for dating the letters more accurately. All Darwin scholars are familiar with this difficult problem and all of them will appreciate help with it.</p>
            <p>The present volume contains a substantial portion (about 15%) of all the Darwin letters that have so far been located. A search is now in progress to find as many more as possible for a "Collected Letters of Charles Darwin" of which I am a Co-Editor with Dr. Sydney Smith of St. Catharine's College, Cambridge. On the basis of my experience, I can attest to the skill and thoroughness with which Mr. Carroll has dealt with the many difficulties that confront an editor of Darwin's correspondence.</p>
            <p>Scholarly interest in Darwin has been growing steadily in recent years and the Library of the American Philosophical Society has become a center of Darwin research on this side of the Atlantic. The present volume is thus a welcome introduction to a collection that has become an indispensable resource for research on the life and work of Charles Darwin and the history of the theory of evolution.</p>

            <head>Acknowledgements</head>
            <p>Despite indications to the contrary on the title page, this calendar was by no means the work of one or even two persons; a great many acknowledgements -- too many, in fact, for all of them to be explicit here, and too deeply felt by the editor for adequate expression in words -- are in order.</p>
            <p>Above all else, of course, this calendar would not have been possible had it not been for the prodigious efforts of Charles Darwin himself, and so this book is his. By poring over his letters, I believe, I have come to know him fairly intimately, and I can assure my readers that, in this case at least, the old adage about familiarity breeding contempt is inapplicable. I know that this admission bodes ill for my retention of a critical historical perspective, but it would be a worse sin for me to feign objectivity. Besides, if my readers study these letters as I have, I think they will agree in all fairness that we should all be grateful that such a wonderful man as Darwin was once among us, however briefly and reclusively.</p>
            <p>I am equally grateful to Darwin's great-grandson, Mr. George P. Darwin, for permission to produce this calendar and to quote extensively from the letters, regardless of the intimacy of their contents; this graciousness demonstrates that devotion to rigorous scholarship is as much the Darwin hallmark today as it was a century ago.</p>
            <p>Financial support for the preparation of this calendar was provided by a generous gift to the American Philosophical Society by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p>
            <p>The commodious facilities of the Library of the American Philosophical Society are a scholar's delight; I am grateful to the Society for the privilege of using them. Each of my colleagues on the Library staff has given generously of his or her time and expertise to the production of this work. Those who have contributed directly to the final manuscript were Helen Black, who conscientiously typed both my handwritten transcriptions of the letters and the manuscript of the front matter, and B. Dodelin, who prepared the photographic prints for the illustrations. Everyone else, each in his or her own way, not only added to this work but also made my stay at the Library pleasurable. I regret that there is not enough space to name them individually.</p>
            <p>Many other individuals aided this project. I am grateful to Dr. Frederick Burkhardt, President Emeritus of the American Council of Learned Societies, for writing the foreword. Special thanks go to Dr. Sydney Smith, Lecturer in Zoology, St. Catharine's College, Cambridge University, and to Mr. Peter Gautrey, Cambridge University Library; with astonishing skill and resourcefulness they helped to date and otherwise identify the most intransigent letters in the collection. Similarly, Dr. Thaddeus J. Trenn, Department of the History of Science, University of Regensburg, helped considerably in the identification of letters from Darwin's cirripede period; in addition, as I discuss in the Introduction, Dr. Trenn has been my collaborator in the attempt to make sense of the many variant Down House addresses in the headings of Darwin's letters. Frederick Burkhardt has helped with the identification and arrangement of some of the letters. Professor Malcolm J. Kottler, Department of Ecology and Behavioral Biology, University of Minnesota, shared with me all of his determinations of the dates and the instances of publication of the Darwin-Romanes letters. Dr. Whitfield J. Bell, Jr., Librarian of the American Philosophical Society, not only supervised the project but also arranged for the publication of the work. In addition to the aid provided to me as part of their regular duties, Mr. Carl F. Miller, Assistant Manuscripts Librarian, and Mr. Murphy D. Smith, Associate Librarian, American Philosophical Society Library, were especially helpful in deciphering the more exotic examples of Darwin's difficult handwriting. The latter also offered many useful suggestions concerning format of entries. Whitfield J. Bell, Jr., Jeffrey L. Sturchio, and Frederick Burkhardt provided criticisms of early drafts of the front matter; Frederick Burkhardt also helped to proofread the calendar entries. Mr. Michael Glazier, President of Scholarly Resources, Inc., has been a generous and patient publisher. Robert F. Bud, Department of the History and Sociology of Science, University of Pennsylvania, helped to investigate British copyrights of the illustrations. Professor Leonard G. Wilson, Department of the History of Medicine, University of Minnesota, helped to publicize the calendar among Darwin scholars.</p>
            <p>The following individuals aided in transcribing, dating, locating, and/or annotating one or more letters: Marianne Abel, Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia; John Angell, Free Library of Philadelphia; Sir Hedley Atkins, M.D., Down House; Suzanne W. Brown, Chicago Academy of Sciences; Colin Burton, Baird &amp; Tatlock (London) Ltd.; Dr. Ralph Colp, Jr.; Professor Joseph Ewan, Department of Biology, Tulane University; Ellen G. Gartrell, Assistant Curator, Historical Collections, College of Physicians of Philadelphia; Sheila K. Hart, Harvard College Library; F. A. Milligan, Hereford and Worcester County [England] Libraries; Professor James A. Rogers, Department of History, Claremont Men's College; Jeffrey L. Sturchio, Department of the History and Sociology of Science, University of Pennsylvania; Margaret Teransky, Free Library of Philadelphia; Philip Titheradge, Down House; and Professor David B. Wilson, Department of History, University of Oklahoma. My colleague and friend Roy Goodman here in the Library is unparalleled as a reference librarian.</p>
            <p>In the course of my research, I have enjoyed the facilities of and/or received the competent assistance of the staffs of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, the Burndy Library, the Chicago Academy of Sciences, the Harvey S. Firestone Library of Princeton University, the Free Library of Philadelphia, the Harvard College Library, the Hereford and Worcester County [England] Libraries, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, and the Charles Patterson Van Pelt Library of the University of Pennsylvania. I am also grateful to all those persons and institutions mentioned in the second appendix for making its compilation possible. A copy of the Darwin letter to Gray which I quote in the introduction was provided by the Gray Herbarium, Harvard University, which has the original. Those who have graciously given permission for reproduction of one or another of the illustrations are acknowledged where the figures appear.</p>
            <p>Preparation of this calendar has consumed much of my time and attention over the last two years. Accordingly, I should like to thank the faculty, the staff, and my fellow graduate students in the Department of the History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylvania for tolerating my reduced visibility around the Department. Similarly, my wife Nan, my late father, and my mother have suffered me cheerfully whenever the excesses of my enthusiasm for Darwin and the history of science have overflowed into my family life.</p>
            <p>Many others, too numerous to mention, have aided the compilation of this volume in some way. Despite all this help, endless factual and interpretive errors, of which I am painfully aware and for which I am solely responsible, undoubtedly remain. I hope that scholars will both forgive me for these and report them to the Library for the benefit of future students of Darwin.</p>

            <p>The Getz Collection (B D25.m) contains additional Darwin Papers, and the Library houses the complete files of the Darwin Papers Editorial Project (Ms. Coll. 28) (including photocopies of all extant Darwin letters) and microfilm of Darwin materials held at Down House (films 496,13; 496,14), along with material relating to Erasmus Darwin and other members of the Darwin family.</p>
            <p>In addition to manuscript letters to and from Charles Darwin, several other items in the Library of the American Philosophical Society may be of interest to the Darwin scholar. These are discussed below in more-or-less general way which, although not a comprehensive list, should give readers some idea of the nature of these collections. The items are discussed in groups, by type of document.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="italic">Manuscript items</emph></p>
            <p>Included under this rubric are three types of documents: 
                <list type="ordered">
                    <item>the correspondence and other papers of those people who corresponded with Darwin--all of it relating directly to manuscript letters calendared above; </item>
                    <item>autograph documents from Darwin's own papers or from others, but relating directly to Darwin and not connected to any of the manuscript letters calendared above; and </item>
                    <item>manuscript correspondence to and from other members of the Darwin family besides Charles Darwin.</item>
                </list></p>
            <p>There are seven items of the first type. All of these pertain to the case of the inheritance of an injury in a goose, as related to Darwin by Reuben A. Blair in the correspondence with him calendared above. The documents are: 1) a photograph of the deformed goose; 2) a letter from Blair concerning the goose and printed in the Sedalia 
                <emph render="italic">Democrat;</emph> 3) a letter from William Henry Flower to Blair; 4) the report by Flower and his assistant, Dr. Larson, on the wings of the affected geese; 5) a letter from Blair to an unnamed correspondent; and 6) letters exchanged between Blair and Spencer Fullerton Baird of the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
            <p>There are twenty items of the second type. These documents are: 1) five leaves from the manuscript of the 
                <emph render="italic">Origin of Species;</emph> 2) a signed page from the manuscript of the 
                <emph render="italic">Descent of Man;</emph> 3) a signed page from some other Darwin manuscript (discusses 
                <emph render="italic">Catasetum);</emph> 4) a printed petition for the endowment of research, issued by J. Norman Lockyer and C. E. Appleton, and signed by Darwin; 5) the final page of the petition for a pension for Alfred Russel Wallace, signed by twelve persons, including Darwin; 6) sketches of Darwin, his wife, grandson, and dog, by Albert Goodwin; 7) documents pertaining to Darwin's funeral in Westminster Abbey (eleven items); 8) inscription from the Carroll # 372 statue of Darwin at Oxford University; 9) a discussion of Darwin's B: D25.176 religion by H. Buxton Forman; and 10) a pass to the Zoological Gardens, issued to James Gough by Darwin.</p>
            <p>There are 44 items of the third type, which is too many to list individually here. Members of the Darwin family involved in this correspondence are: Emma Wedgwood Darwin (two letters, correspondence with Mrs. Georgiana Rosetta Smyth Flower and with John Maurice Herbert); Francis Darwin (39 letters, correspondence with Leo Abram Errera, George John Romanes, Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing, and Otto Zacharias); and George Howard Darwin (three letters, correspondence with F. W. Surman and Otto Zacharias).</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="italic">Photocopies of manuscript items</emph></p>
            <p>The Library has 26 documents pertaining to Darwin, the originals of which are located elsewhere; only photographically-reproduced paper copies of the documents are at the APS. These fall into two categories: photocopies of manuscript correspondence with Darwin; and photocopies of Darwin-related documents from the papers of Darwin correspondents. In the first category, there are copies of correspondence with the College of Physicians of Philadelphia (one letter), Ignatius Donnelly (two letters), Hugo de Vries (one letter), Benjamin Dann Walsh (eighteen letters), and Jeffries Wyman (two letters). In the second category, there is a photocopy of a letter from Frank J. Mead, editor of the 
                <emph render="italic">Minneapolis Evening Times,</emph> to Ignatius Donnelly, concerning Darwinism and Christianity, and a photocopy of a portion of Donnelly's diary which mentions Darwin.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="italic">Microfilms of manuscript items</emph></p>
            <p>The Library has nine sets of microfilms of Darwin materials which are on deposit at various institutions all over the world. These films contain the following: 1) correspondence in possession of Down House, Kent (one reel); 2) correspondence in the Robert Stecher Collection at the Cleveland Medical Library Association (one reel); 3) correspondence in the New York Botanical Garden (one reel); letters to Auguste H. Forel, from originals in the Medicinhistorisches Institut, University of Switzerland, and in University of Basel Library (sixteen frames); 4) letters to Bernhard Studer and to A. von Morlot (seven items); 5) letters to J. Moulinie, A. Dohrn, Karl Christoph Vogt, Pictet, and de la Rive, from originals in the Bibliotheque Publique et Universitaire de Geneve (25 letters); 6) notebooks written during the voyage of the 
                <emph render="italic">Beagle,</emph> from Down House, Kent (eighteen notebooks, one reel); 7) diary and correspondence written during the voyage of the 
                <emph render="italic">Beagle,</emph> from Down House, Kent (one reel); and 9) chronology and bibliography of Darwin's life, compiled by Sir Gavin de Beer, containing an incomplete list of all of Darwin's correspondence (two reels).</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="italic">Photographs and prints</emph></p>
            <p>The Library has approximately twelve different photographs and prints of Darwin and of Down House. Some of the best of these are used as illustrations in this calendar.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="italic">Books</emph></p>
            <p>There are about 150 copies of various editions of Darwin's works in the Library, plus a fair collection of some of the rarer and/or more significant editions of the works of his correspondents, colleagues, and contemporary naturalists and biologists. Space does not permit a full listing of the 150 works by Darwin in the Library, but it is possible to give some indication of the collection by referring to the number assigned to each edition held by the Library in the standard bibliography of Darwin's works (R. B. Freeman, 
                <emph render="italic">The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist</emph> [London: Dawsons of Pall Mall, 1965]). The "Freeman numbers" of the Library's holdings are given below, without comment.</p>

                <emph render="italic">Subject card catalogs</emph></p>
            <p>For a great many years, the Library has maintained subject card catalogs on Darwinism. These catalogs list any published work among the Library's holdings which mentions or discusses Darwin and/or Darwinism. They provide an unparalleled source for study of the influence of Darwin upon society and upon Western thought. There is one card catalog for books, containing approximately 2,800 entries, and another for journal articles, containing approximately 1,000 entries.</p>
            <p>An effort has been made to make this appendix as complete as possible, but as the Library is constantly adding to its Darwin holdings, the careful scholar is warned that this compendium will be out of date in a short time.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="italic">Other Darwin Letters in the Greater Philadelphia Area</emph></p>
            <p>It is expected that this calendar will render unnecessary many visits to Philadelphia by Darwin scholars which would have been mandatory otherwise. While this is a beneficial result of the publication of this book, it is not without its harmful side effects. The worst of these would have been that the many miscellaneous Darwin materials in other institutions in the Philadelphia area might be neglected; this appendix is designed to prevent this by listing the results of a search by mail for other manuscript Darwin letters in select institutions in the greater Philadelphia area.</p>
            <p>To conduct the search, a form letter was sent to the 31 institutions in the area judged by the editor to be the most likely to possess Darwin letters. Thirty institutions replied; they are listed below, and the name of the person responding is given for each institution.</p>

            <p>One of the most important natural historians in nineteenth-century Britain, Charles Darwin provided the first compelling mechanism to account for organismal evolutionary change. In at least two letters in the Darwin collection, the naturalist reflects upon the nature of race. In a letter dated

                        <p>1. Darwin visited first Maer, then Shrewsbury, for "some weeks" during 1839, 1840, 1841, 1842, and 1844. Given the watermark of this letter, and CD's unwellness during the visit, I am inclined toward the earlier of these years, and have thus eliminated 1844. To fix the exact year, one would have to identify and date Herbert's "

                            <emph render="super">2</emph> on Scandinavian drift by [Roderick Impey] Murchison errs by "speaking of...successive terraces as the direct effects of so many elevations [rather than as] the indirect effect of an elevation, &amp; the direct effect of the sea's destroying power...."; does not know whether old Tertiary beds of South America were submerged until recent layers set down, but certain they were slowly uplifted, with low parts long submerged; "I think this absence of any considerable recent fossiliferous deposits on both E. &amp; W. coasts, the most remarkable thing I observed" in South America; see page 135 of Darwin, 
                            <emph render="italic">South America</emph> (1846); this subject "helps to explain the breaks in Geological chronology &amp; has disabused my mind of a prejudice that

                        <p>1. CD refers to 
                            <emph render="italic">Jl R. hort. Soc.</emph> (see Stauffer, ed., 
                            <emph render="italic">CD's Nat. Selection,</emph> index entries under William Herbert); first volume published in 1846, thereby setting lower endpoint for date. Articles by Herbert appeared in volumes 1 (1846) and 2 (1847), but in no later volumes. Corr. seems to be William Hutton, because John Lindley was a close friend and colleague of this Hutton and was also a leading figure in the Horticultural Society of London at this time; moreover, William Hutton was a geologist with an interest in botany and fossils, which suggests both that CD knew him and that he would be interested in horticultural matters. William Hutton died in 1860, thereby setting upper endpoint for date. He was on the island of Malta from 1846 to 1857 (see 
                            <emph render="italic">DNB, 28,</emph> 363), leaving only 1846 and 1857-1860 as possible dates for letter. Black border indicates death in Darwin family; only deaths during these years were CD's mother-in-law in 1846 (see 
                            <emph render="italic">Emma Darwin,</emph> II, 89) and CD's son and his eldest sister in 1858 (see "Darwin's Journal," 14 and 14n). Earlier year chosen because style of handwriting and ink used (a lighter brown than usual) match style and ink of 1846 letters better than style and ink of 1858 letters.</p>

                        <p>1. Down variant address used determines endpoints of 1846 and 1855. During this period, two deaths necessitated use of black border, viz. death of CD's father on November 13, 1848, and death of CD's daughter Anne on April 23, 1851. Dimensions and width of black border on this letter match those letters from October, 1849, but not of October, 1851.</p>

                        <p>1. There are three reasons for choosing this date: 1) CD finished the pedunculated cirripedes and commenced the sessile in April, 1850 (see "Darwin's Journal," 12); 2) the November 7, 1849, meeting of the Geological Society of London; and 3) the black-bordered stationery, in mourning for the death of CD's father in November, 1848.</p>
                        <p>2. This letter is bound in a letter-book amid other letters to Cuming. See also the next note.</p>

Black border on this particular letter is too narrow for 1849, as others of the same period have a much more prominent border. In addition, CD published on Balanidae in 1851, which explains why he should have received an unsolicited gift of

                        <p>Portion of AL is: thanks for letter; CD "astonished &amp; delighted at your discovery of a Cretacean chthamalus", a curious, publishable discovery; usually does not believe in

                            <emph render="italic">Fossil Lepadidae,</emph> 5), and now Bosquet's discovery proves CD wrong to deviate; cautions Bosquet against "
                            <emph render="italic">ever</emph> presuming to say 
                            <emph render="italic">when</emph> a new group first...appeared"; on structure of recent chthamalus, see Darwin, 
                            <emph render="italic">Recent Balanidae,</emph> 39; see also page 172 on non-existence of extinct Chthamalinae; drawings sent by Bosquet are beautiful; has been "so hard at work for two years at other subjects that cirripedes are gone rather out of my head, which could never boast of a good memory"; compliments Bosquet's ability; Lithotrya specimen must exhibit serrations, important for burrowing, on upper scales of peduncle (see Darwin,

                        <p>Thanks for letter and for reference on hybrid; line on growth of bones of birds is new and interesting; ill, but makes "steady progress in my Book on Variation of Species &amp; on domestic varieties"; watch in Ireland or elsewhere for horses or ponies with bars on legs, as with zebra, or on shoulder and along back, as with ass.

                        <p>1. The only two years in which CD both worked on his big book (i.e. Stauffer, ed.,

I am guessing at June, 1857, because of the earlier letter to Eyton on June 9, 1857 (above), and because I believe this is the best candidate date for Eyton to have told CD about the growth of bones of birds.</p>

                        <p>Thanks for letter of December 28, with information on resistance of plants to Ceylonese climate and on acclimatization of plants to differing elevations; will quote Thwaites about several species having both alpine and lowland forms and about some having and some not having intermediate varieties;

                            <emph render="italic">much smaller</emph> and more numerous flowers with longer, narrower, and less coriaceous leaves; disbelieves, as does [Joseph Dalton] Hooker, the idea that alpine forms have the character of "hariness [?i.e. hairiness]", so is glad that Thwaites does not mention this trait; "I was lately struck by a remark in U[nited] States Naturalist, namely that introduced or naturalised plants 
                            <emph render="italic">at first</emph> overrun the whole country, &amp; then in some degree diminish in numbers.... I can see some likely causes of error in the...remark, &amp; yet the fact in itself seems probable.";

                        <p>Thanks for note; sorry to miss [B.A.A.S. meeting at] Leeds [on September 22]; Eyton's skeleton collection is "splendid"; sees that Eyton is publishing on oysters;

                            <emph render="super">2</emph> gives final arguments in favor of elevation and subsidence theory to explain Glen Roy; "But I suppose ice-lakes must be true cause"; disagrees with Lyell's claim in former letter that great glaciers in Scotland caused by great loftiness; glacial phenomena great in extent and prevalence [during ice age]; seems safest to assume great glacial period to be simultaneous until shown otherwise.</p>

Enclosure is a portion of an undated ALS from Benjamin Dann Walsh, presumably addressed to CD, which is entirely crossed out except for the following: "If you happen to know any Ornithologist who wishes to exchange European Birds for North American birds, I have a particular friend here, `Dr. Velie, Rock Island, Illinois,' who has a very fine collection &amp; is an excellent manipulator of birds'-skins. He is also an honorable man to exchange with, which is more than can be said of certain naturalists. But don't put yourself to any trouble on account of this matter."

                        <p>Lyell's point is good; when reading [James] Croll,

                            <emph render="super">2</emph> is too high, even if estimate of present rate is correct; "Somehow I cannot persuade myself that the Glacial period was much more recent than hitherto supposed"; would like to hear Croll's reply to this; sorry about "Amazonian shells".</p>

                        <p>Thanks for Wood's interesting letter; there is much evidence that varieties of fruit trees transmit characters to a large extent, but Wood's cases exhibit exceptionally close identity; [Joseph] Decaisne has recorded cases of surprising diversity; sterility of Wood's seedlings is most remarkable point; "...if they had been planted separately in good ground, they wd not have been so sterile after early youth"; consider, for example, great fertility of seedling peach trees in Americas and in Australia; returns Wood's letter.</p>

                        <p>Thanks for reference, which CD had lost and is delighted to recover and to quote; will discuss point mooted in corr.'s letter; all organs 
                            <emph render="italic">necessary</emph> for reproduction are attributed to natural selection; sexual selection occurs only when advantage is gained by struggle between two or more individuals of same sex; males vary more than females; corr. may consider this a result of masculine " `vital force' ", but CD prefers to speak of it as mere variability; this variability does not account for well-marked sexual differences unless variations are accumulated; when sexes are alike, there is no evidence of sexual selection, unless two sexes closely resemble one sex of closely allied form in which sexes differ; if sexes differ much in color, esp. if male is more brilliant, then brightness of male is probably due to sexual selection; evidence of action of sexual selection is only good if one sex displays its colors to the other; individual would not display colors unless this were an advantage, and if it is advantage, this is basis for sexual selection; corr. probably does not think stridulatory organs of insects result from vital force; if such organs result from sexual selection, why not color; [Giovanni] Canestrini says in recent Italian paper that female spiders select a mate from among many males; collected spiders during voyage of

According to "Darwin's Journal," 19-21, there were eleven weeks in which CD was at Bryanston Street address on both Monday and Wednesday, between 1873 (first possible year of correspondence with Romanes) and 1882 (year of CD's death). Type 8 address variant was not employed until at least late 1874. CD begins greeting Romanes by name in salutations to letters on December 16, 1874, but this letter begins with "My dear sir". Letter is thus dated with the only candidate Monday in late 1874, namely December 7. This may indicate first use of type 8 variant.</p>

                            <emph render="italic">Variation under Domestication,</emph> chap. XX; corr.'s son forgets effects of isolation on crossing; corr.'s son "says I rest exclusively on natural selection; whereas no one else as far as I know has made so many observations on the effects of use &amp; disuse. Nor do I deny the direct effect of external conditions, tho' I probably underrated their power in the earlier editions of the Origin. We know far too little about the laws of inheritance to argue about them: what is certain is that some new variations are strongly inherited from the first, whilst some seem never to very rarely to be transmitted; nor until trial is made can we predict what will be the result"; [Richard] Owen says open spaces in teeth of race horses were specially designed for bit; "no doubt the little jockeys were specially designed to ride them"; dismisses final cause for lowering of specific gravity of water upon freezing, giving bismuth as counterexample.</p>

                        <p>Darwin declines to become involved in the work necessary to publish Morlot's journal, to the fragile state of his health, which limits his time and energies. Although he recommends possible publishers in England for the journal, he expresses skepticism about Morlot's glacier theory, emphasizing instead the role of floating ice.</p>

                        <p>Darwin says he instructed his publisher to send [Bernhard] Studer a copy of his small book on South America, although he fears that he will find little of use in it, except a brief discussion on cleavage and foliation. He said that he was also glad to hear about Studer's article that appeared in the Bulletin, and promised to consult it. Darwin recommends that Studer read Daniel Sharpe's paper "On slaty cleavage" in the Journal of the Geological Society of London 3(1847): 74-105. Darwin thanks Studer for his offer of his book [Lehrbuch der physikalischen Geographie und Geologie, (1844-47)], but says his German is poor, and that Studer ought to send it only if it is short and inexpensive.</p>
