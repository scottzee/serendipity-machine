            <p>Born in Ireland, Thomas Sullivan served as a Sergeant in the British 49th Regiment of Foot under the command of Alexander Maitland. He arrived in North America during the fall of 1775, in time to witness the Battle of Bunker Hill and take part in the evacuation of British forces from Boston. From there, he proceeded with his regiment into the Long Island and Philadelphia campaigns, participating in a number of engagements.</p>
            <p>By 1778, Sullivan's disaffection with service in the British Army seems to have reached a high tide. "Seeing American under arms," he wrote, and seeing that the Americans "were striving to throw off the Yoke, under which my native country sunk for many years," he deserted the British army in June, and made his way to Philadelphia. There, on July 4th, he agreed to become a steward to General Nathanael Greene, Quartermaster General for the Continental Army.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>An excellent first hand narrative of the early years of the American Revolution written by Thomas Sullivan, an Irish-born sergeant serving with the British 49th Regiment of Foot. In polished prose, Sullivan describes the events from his arrival in North America just prior to the Battle of Bunker Hill through his participation in the Long Island, Philadelphia, and New Jersey Campaigns.</p>
            <p>Sullivan's journal is written in a meticulous hand and may originally have been intended for publication. It does not appear to have seen print, however, until extracts appeared in the 
                <title render="italic">Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography</title> in 1910. In 1997, the complete journal, edited by Joseph Lee Boyle, was published by Heritage Books.</p>
            <p>Among the engagements described are Bunker Hill, Long Island, White Plains, Brandywine, Germantown, and Red Bank, but he reports as well on events that he did not personally witness, drawing liberally upon published sources to fill out his narrative.</p>
            <p>The "diary" ends abruptly with the entry for July 28, 1778.</p>

            <p>In beautiful script, these two volumes track the history of Thomas Sullivan, a non-commissioned British soldier, during his time fighting in the American Revolution. Sullivan's journal records the evacuation of Boston, the New Jersey campaign, and the occupation of Philadelphia. Sullivan often gives detailed accounts of various towns he visits, such as Halifax, Boston, Princeton, and Brunswick. The journal ends in 1778, when Sullivan deserted the British Army and joined the Continental Army, serving under Nathanael Greene.</p>
