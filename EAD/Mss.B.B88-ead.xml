            <p>The Charles Bunbury Collection contains a wealth of information on fossils. Sir Charles Bunbury was a nineteenth century geologist and paleontologist. The majority of the documents in collection are Bunbury’s own notes on the subject of fossils. These very detailed notes contain a wealth of information on fossil finds and can provide insight into the prevailing ideas and debates about fossil remains. The collection includes a range of material, including a draft of an essay on algae, reports and analysis of important fossil finds, and reviews and notes on recent publications. The collection also includes a number of Bunbury’s private notebooks in which he describes fossils he has seen or read about in great detail, thus giving modern researchers access to information on remains that may no longer be in existence.</p>
            <p>These notebooks range from general notes on geology, mineralogy, and botany to notebooks on specific fossils and places. One of his notebooks, for instance, details fossils found in the Geological Society Museum, recounting where it was discovered and what it looks like. Other notebooks describe fossilized plants from Richmond, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Sydney, Cape Breton, fossilized ferns from Aix-la-Chapelle, and miscellaneous finds from other places such as Portage County, Ohio.</p>
            <p>Although Bunbury was interested in geology and fossils in general, the bulk of this collection and his own work focused on fossilized flora.</p>
