            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Born in New Rochelle, N.Y., on December 15, 1908, William Nelson Fenton, became a leading scholar of the history and culture of Iroquois Indians. Raised in New Rochelle until the age of 16, he passed his summers on the family farm in western New York state, located midway between two Seneca Indian reservations. Exposed to anthropological work, Fenton's interests were encouraged by his father and grandfather, friends to Indians there, who assembled a small collection of Indian memorabilia which was later acquired by the Museum of the American Indian.</p>
            <p>After receiving his B.A. from Dartmouth in 1931, Fenton attended Yale for graduate study in anthropology. At the end of his first year in New Haven, the Laboratory of Anthropology at Santa Fe awarded him a scholarship for training in field archaeology on the Great Plains of Nebraska and South Dakota, where he took part in his first professional ethnological interviews. Returning to his old home in New York in 1933, Fenton embarked on what would become more than fifty years of field research on the Allegany, Cornplanter, Cattaraugus, and Tonawanda Seneca Reservations and on the Six Nations Reserve in Canada. From 1935 until he received his doctorate in 1937, Fenton also served as a community worker for the United States Indian Service, working principally on the Tonawanda Reservation.</p>
            <p>In his first academic appointment in 1937, Fenton introduced anthropology to St. Lawrence University, though he remained for only three semesters before being called to replace J.N.B. Hewitt at the Bureau of American Ethnology (BAE) of the Smithsonian Institution, earning promotion to Senior Ethnologist in 1943. During the war years, he served as a Research Associate of the Ethnogeographic Board and as Secretary of the Smithsonian War Committee. While a member of the Committee on International Relations in Anthropology at the National Research Council (NRC) from 1952 to 1954, he served as the first Executive Secretary of the Division of Anthropology and Psychology. Meanwhile, he was employed as a visiting professor at Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, and Catholic Universities, and at the University of Michigan.</p>
            <p>In 1954, Fenton returned to New York State with his wife, Olive (1908-1986), and their three children to become Assistant Commissioner of the New York State Museum and Science Service in Albany, serving as director of the State Museum for thirteen years. In 1968, he abandoned administration and returned to teaching as Research Professor of Anthropology at the State University of New York at Albany. In 1979, the trustees named him Distinguished Professor, and Anthony F.C. Wallace delivered the honorary lecture.</p>
            <p>Throughout his career, Fenton's research centered on the religious ceremonies and customs of the Iroquois, epitomised by his translation (with Elizabeth Moore) of 
                <title render="italic">The Customs of the American Indian Compared with the Customs of Primitive Times by Father Joseph François Lafitau</title>, and hy his most influential work, his 1987 book, 
                <title render="italic">The False Faces of the Iroquois</title>.</p>
            <p>Fenton received numerous awards, including the Peter Doctor Award of the Seneca Nation (1958), the Cornplanter Medal for Iroquois Research (1965), the Citizen Laureate Award of the University of Albany Foundation (1978), the Distinguished Service Award of the American Anthropological Association (1983), and an LL.D. from Hartwick College (1968). He was president of the American Folklore Society (1959-1960), the American Ethnological Society (1959), and the American Society for Ethnohistory (1961); a Board member of the American Anthropological Association; and a trustee of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation (1976-1989). He was a founder of the Conference on Iroquois Research in 1945, and a founding member of the SUNY Albany chapter of Sigma Xi. He was also a long-time member of the Phillips Fund Committee of the American Philosophical Society (1975-1991) and of the American Committee of the Permanent Council of the International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences (1952-1972), as well as Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the State University of New York at Albany. He passed away on June 17, 2005.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The William N. Fenton Papers (1635-1994) contain correspondence, subject files, manuscripts of published and unpublished works by Fenton, papers by colleagues, research notes, and photographs, which document Fenton's career as an anthropologist. The most recent items in the collection are letters dated 1994. Documenting both Fenton's research on the Iroquois and the evolution of Iroquois studies, the collection also includes photocopies of primary materials dating back into the seventeeth century.</p>
            <p>The Fenton Papers focus on Iroquois ethnology and political history, and include an important series of correspondence between Fenton and his Seneca consultants, Clara and Sherman Redeye and Jesse J. Cornplanter, 1933-1967, among others. Fenton also gathered works written by Cornplanter himself. Of related interest are a collection of Seneca genealogies; the extensive documentation of the protracted controversy between the Seneca Nation and the U.S. Government over the construction of the Kinzua Dam; and material concerning Fenton's controversial role in resisting early attempts at cultural repatriation waged by the Onondaga Indians in the "Great Wampum War of 1970" (restricted access; see: Fenton, "The New York State Wampum Collection: The Case for the Integrity of Cultural Treasures," APS 
                <title render="italic">Proceedings</title>. 115:6, 1971).</p>
            <p>Having been instrumental in their organization, Fenton kept a wealth of material on the Conferences on Iroquois Research, 1948-1966. Fenton's research on Iroquois ceremonial False Faces is documented by research notes, photographs, and a penultimate draft of the book manuscript, and his participation in international anthropological organizations is evidenced by the material on the International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences. Of special note is the journal he kept for the VIIth International Congress which met in Moscow in 1964. There is also material on the Committee on International Relations in Anthropology, 1945-1950. A series of thirteen tape recordings of Seneca social dance songs (the originals of which are at the Indian University Archive of Folk and Primitive Music) rounds out the Iroquois material.</p>
            <p>Among the miscellaneous materials in the collection are copies of the original, and unpublished, Iroquois field notebooks of Alexander A. Goldenweiser, taken at the Six National Reserve in Canada, 1911-1918. Edward Sapir, who supervised Goldenweiser's research, helped Fenton recover the originals, which Goldenweiser passed to Sapir's graduate students, and ultimately to Fenton in the 1930s. The originals were sent to the National Museum of Man in Canada during the 1970s. There is material concerning Fenton's preparation of these notebooks for publication, including a very informative introduction prepared by one of Fenton's graduate students.</p>
            <p>The papers (107 boxes; 56.5 linear feet) are divided into seven series:</p>

                    <p>Incoming and outgoing manuscript and typescript letters, carbons, telegrams, and postcards generated during Fenton's career. The largest series in the collection, Series I is arranged alphabetically by correspondent's name and then chronologically within each folder. Unidentified correspondence has been filed as "Unidentified" and is arranged chronologically. Enclosed manuscripts have been removed from this series and placed in Series III or IV as appropriate. As with the reprints, a photocopy of the title page was filed with the original letter. The bulk of this series covers the years 1930 to 1993.</p>
                    <p>Correspondents include anthropologists, government officials, students, publishers, Native Americans, and interested amateur anthropologists. Among the topics covered in this series are: Iroquois ceremonies and customs, relocation and administration of the Museum of the American Indian, and Smithsonian Institution's Bureau of American Ethnology. For lists of correspondence related to construction of Kinzua Dam and to wampum belts, see the folders labeled "Kinzua Dam" and "Wampum" in Series II. Material relevant to Fenton's work for the United States Indian Service is filed under "United States. Department of the Interior." Letters of reference are filed under the name of the person who is the subject of the letter. For lists of correspondence with colleagues about Fenton's publications, see Series III under the publications' titles.</p>

                    <p>Minutes, reports, agenda, conference abstracts, bulletins, legal documents, calendars, and newspaper clippings, arranged alphabetically by title. The earliest item in this series is a photocopy of an 1846 library catalog from the Thomas Indian School. The Museum of the American Indian files, which include minutes and agenda from the period when Fenton was an active board member, account for a significant portion of Series II. Fenton's reports on travel and work completed as a community worker for the U.S. Department of the Interior appear in this series as well. Of interest is the material on the construction of Kinzua Dam on the Allegheny River, and on the plans to establish Iroquoia, a tourist center to provide an historically accurate re-creation of an Iroquois community. Also of note are the wampum files which contain material on the ownership of numerous wampum belts at the Museum of the American Indian, the Rochester Museum and Science Center, and the New York State Museum. Copies of the title pages of reprints by and about Horatio Hale are filed under "Hale" in the series.</p>

                    <p>Material gathered during a project undertaken by the Newberry Library to compile a documentary history of the Iroquois. Involved in the project were Fenton, Francis P. Jennings, and Mary A. Druke Becker, among others. This series contains material that was compiled by the project, including photocopies of historical documents, such as treaties, deeds, and minutes of meetings with Iroquois leaders. There are two folders of project reports ("Iroquois Documentary History Project Reports") written by Becker, Fenton, and Jennings. Correspondence involving this project has been filed in Series I, in the files of Becker and Jennings.</p>

                    <p>Fenton's typewritten and handwritten drafts, and outlines, preparatory notes and research for articles, books, reviews, lectures, and tributes to colleagues. This series is arranged by title. Cross-references appear for correspondence, photographs, and reprints which appear in this series. The earliest materials in this series are research items gathered for 
                        <title render="italic">The Customs of the American Indian Compared with the Customs of Primitive Times by Father Joseph François Lafitau</title>, including photocopies of several journals from the early 1700s. Fenton's earliest manuscripts were written in 1931: "Outdoor Wisdom," a review of William Hillcourt's 
                        <title render="italic">The Boy Campers</title>, and "Thoreau on Education," a paper written when Fenton was a student at Dartmouth. There is also a 1932 paper, "The Connecticut Algonkians," which was written for George P. Murdock's course in ethnology at Yale. Of note are the drafts, notes, and research for 
                        <title render="italic">The False Faces of the Iroquois</title>. "Social and Ceremonial Organization of the Six Nations Reserve in 1910," a proposal for publication of Alexander A. Goldenweiser's notebooks, is interesting in the way Fenton chooses to organize the material. Also of note is Fenton's translation of the Deganawidah epic as it was conveyed to Goldenweiser. Several drafts of "Mohawk," co-authored by Elisabeth Tooker, appear in this series as well. Materials for several of Fenton's articles on Horatio Hale are filed under "Hale."</p>

                    <p>Articles, notes, and papers written by colleagues and students of Fenton. This series is arranged alphabetically by author and then by title. Authors with three or more manuscripts in this series include Raymond D. Fogelson, Francis P. Jennings, Gertrude Prokosch Kurath, and Elisabeth Tooker. Also included are photocopies of many of Alexander A. Goldenweiser's Iroquois Notebooks containing Goldenweiser's research which was sponsored by the Anthropological Division of the National Museum of Canada in the early 1900s (Fenton's unpublished version of Goldenweiser's notebooks is contained in Series III under the title "Social and Ceremonial Organization on the Six Nations Reserve in 1910"). A photocopy of Edward Cornplanter's handwritten version of the Handsome Lake Code is also contained in Series IV.</p>

                    <p>Loose notes, notebooks, and card files. The notes and notebooks are arranged by folder title and include the subjects of Seneca social and political organization, plants and medicine, song texts, and Seneca genealogies. Series V also includes six card files: "Ethnography of North America I," "Ethnography of North America II and Oceania + Australia," "Herbarium: Allegany Seneca Systematics," "Iroquois Medicines (F. Waugh Waugh)," "Sources and References in Lafitau / Political Anthropology," and "Materia Medica and Seneca Place Names." The card files provide a bibliography for those areas of study, as well as abstracts and quotations of source material. Notes which were too large to fit in the card file boxes were placed in folders and filed with the notes and notebooks. A photocopy of the first sheet of notes was placed in the card file with a cross reference. Similarly, photographs were removed to Series VI, and photocopies were placed in the card file with a cross reference.</p>

                    <p>Photographs, both positive and negative, of Fenton's activities while in the field, artifacts, and false faces, and friends. The majority of the negatives in this series document Fenton's field work in the 1930s and 1940s. Fenton assigned a number to each negative and maintained an index which is arranged by negative number; this index is filed in Series VI under "Negatives." There are few prints of Fenton's field work, with the exception of his friends and informants, including Simeon Gibson, Helen Harris, Henry Redeye, Howard Sky, and Jones Snow. Photographs of false faces account for most of the prints. The false face material falls into two sections according to its original order. The first section, filed under "False Faces," retains Fenton's original distinctions by type of false face (e.g. "smiling," "spoon mouth blower"). Additional false face photographs removed from Series I-V have been titled "False Faces" but have not been interfiled with Fenton's original files. The other false face photographs were originally filed with the drafts of 
                        <title render="italic">The False Faces of the Iroquois</title>. This section includes information on printing, reduction or enlargement, captions, and figures; these prints have been filed under 
                        <title render="italic">The False Faces of the Iroquois</title>. Series VI also includes several photographs of the wampum transfer from the Museum of the American Indian to the Six Nations Reserve in 1988. For additional prints of several of Fenton's negatives, see the George S. Snyderman Papers, Coll. No. 51.</p>
                    <p>Native American Images Note : Over 1,000 negatives of Iroquoian life on the Tonawanda and Allegany reservations of western New York from 1933-1951. Images depict Seneca Indians social customs including dances, sports, festivals, societies and other everyday activities. Taken by Fenton with Native American consultants Chauncey Johnny John, Jonas Snow, and Henry Redeye, the 1937-1941 negatives show details of wearing and carving of false faces. Also, over 1,500 black and white, some color, photographs of museum exhibited false faces. Collected from the Museum of the American Indian-Heye Foundation, The Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology, and the Buffalo Historical Society, the black and red wooden masks illustrate such expressions as hanging mouth, protruding tongue, and grimace with teeth. The balance of the collection contain photographs of wampum, corn husk masks, rattles, and drums with some oversize maps of Native American reservations near Lakes Erie and Ontario. Note: Iroquoian False Faces are considered sacred so respectful use of the collection is requested.</p>
