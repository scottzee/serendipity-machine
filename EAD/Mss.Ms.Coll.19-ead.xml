            <p>Herman Heine Goldstine was a professor of mathematics (University of Chicago, 1936-1939; University of Michigan, 1939-1950) and was involved in the early development of the computer during World War II and the 1950s. He continued to publish on the history of these subjects. He has held many administrative positions in scientific research with International Business Machines Corporation, namely, Director of Mathematical Sciences, Research (1958-1960); Director of Scientific Development, IBM Research (1960-1965); Director of Scientific Development, Data Processing Division (1965-1967); and Consultant to Director of Research (1967-1969). He continues as a IBM Fellow (1969- ) and a Permanent Member of the Institute for Advanced Study (1952- ).</p>

            <head>Arrangement note</head>
            <p>Much of the correspondence (15 boxes) is arranged under corporate entries (associations, government agencies, etc.) with related supporting documentation, e.g., reports. There are also three notebooks of administrative correspondence from the IBM Watson Research Center, 1963-1964. The reports in the collection (8 10 boxes), many of which are photocopies and marked restricted and confidential (no longer the case), are from the Aberdeen Proving Ground, IBM, and elsewhere. There are about 3 boxes of legal documents (briefs, depositions, court transcripts, patent proceedings, etc.) that concern various computer related cases in which Goldstine was involved. Material concerning his publications includes photocopies of data, drafts of manuscripts, reprints, etc. particularly concerning his writings on the history of the computer (The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann, 1972). There are also photographic slides used for oral presentations concerning this topic.</p>
            <p>In addition to Dr. Goldstine's papers there are several folders of correspondence of his first wife, Dr. Adele Goldstine (d. 1964), who worked with him professionally. Correspondents of note include Paul N. Gillon, John von Neumann, and Leslie E. Simon. This collection is presently unorganized.</p>
