            <p>A veteran of the French and Indian War and associate of George Washington, the Virginian George Weedon became an ardent proponent to the revolutionary cause. Elected colonel of the 3rd Virginia Regiment on August 13, 1776, Weedon served under Washington's command in New York and in the vicinity of Philadelphia, earning election to Brigadier General on February 21, 1777. He retired from the army, however, early in 1778 when his rival, William Woodford, was given seniority over him at Valley Forge. Weedon later returned to duty with the Virginia Militia, acquitting himself well during the Virginia Campaign of 1781.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The Valley Forge Orderly Book contains records of General, Divisional, and Brigade orders received under the command of George Weedon between August 25, 1777 and May 7, 1778. Evocative of the hardships faced by the Continental Army during the bitter winter of 1777-1778, the orderly contains the standard round of orders relating to duties and disciplinary matters. The orderly book also includes a plan of battle for the Battle of Germantown, 1777, and plans for the troops at Mount Holly (November 1777) and what appears to be Whitemarsh (November 1777).</p>
