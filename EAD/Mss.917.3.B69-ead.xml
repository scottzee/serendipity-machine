            <p>This journal is a short but interesting account of travel in antebellum America. The author of the journal is Francis P. Lee. Lee appears to be a young adult or teenager at the time. The journal begins on August 15, 1833 in Morristown and ends in Camden, S.C. on September 5. The journal details this trip. The journal writer, Francis P. Lee, is traveling with his father and others. The group, which appears to have been composed of members of the same family, traveled on a mix of overland coaches and steamboats. There are many observations on the social and cultural life of areas they passed through as well as details on what travel was like in the 1830s. The daily entries are very detailed and recount both the personal dynamics between the travelers and observations about the towns and people they meet along the way.</p>
            <p>Francis Lee became an ordained Episcopal minister in 1836 in Philadelphia, headed a diocese in Tallahassee, Florida until 1841, returned to Camden in 1842 as a minister, and then traveled to Alabama to preach at a church there.</p>
