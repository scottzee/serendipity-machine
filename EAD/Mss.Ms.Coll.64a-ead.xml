            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The voluminous Anthony Wallace Papers contain a wealth of material for scholars of anthropology, history, and psychiatry. At first glance, the collection appears quite eclectic, yet common themes of technological, social, and cultural change unite the seemingly disparate subjects, providing a broad range of source materials for the study of technological and social change, American Indians, personality and culture, revitalization movements, the cultural and biological bases of behavior, and Pennsylvania history, particularly that of Delaware and Schuylkill Counties.</p>
            <p>Along with Wallace's correspondence to and from such anthropologists as Frank G. Speck, A. Irving Hallowell, William N. Fenton, Floyd Lounsbury, and others, the collection includes extensive correspondence with knowledgeable local historians, reflecting Wallace's awareness of the benefits as well as the liabilities of their homegrown knowledge. There is extensive correspondence from Merle Deardorff of Warren, Pennsylvania and Robert Scherr of Schuylkill County; Deardorff's correspondence in particular provides a wealth of information on Iroquois history and traditions as well as the occasional sharp and uncompromising criticism of Wallace's work.</p>
            <p>Wallace's research notes, drafts of his works, and photocopies of primary source material from various repositories and reprints of secondary sources comprise the majority of the collection. His assemblage of 19th century census and tax records, church records, and local histories for the Pennsylvania towns of Rockdale and St. Clair provides researchers with a centralized resource of materials from various repositories. Card files of information collected on various families of Delaware and Schuylkill Counties represent a valuable resource for scholars of Pennsylvania history as well as genealogists. The reprints, on topics ranging from social and technological change, personality and culture, and psychiatric research to Indian history and Pennsylvania coal region history appear in the subseries related to these subjects.</p>
            <p>News clippings and magazine articles related to Wallace's work appear throughout the collection. The most significant include articles on federal efforts to recruit anthropologists for counterinsurgency and other politically-motivated missions, particularly in Thailand, and the Kinzua Dam controversy, when the state of New York built a dam that flooded much of the historic Cornplanter Grant on the Allegany Reservation. The collection also contains extensive materials on the Indian land claims cases of the 1950s, in which Wallace served as an expert witness.</p>
            <p>Notes and research materials for Wallace's works since 1990 are not currently included in the collection, but Series IV, Works by Wallace, does include the original manuscript draft of his 1999 work on Thomas Jefferson and the Indians under the working title 
                <title render="italic">Logan's Mourner</title>.</p>
            <p>In addition to documenting the Wallaces' professional careers, the collection documents the personal side of their family through correspondence, photograph albums, and histories dating from the 1920s that also describe 19th century people and events. The family albums include three histories compiled by Paul A.W. Wallace; two histories compiled by Paul Wallace's father, clergyman Francis Huston Wallace; 19th century images of Wallace ancestors, homes, and the Wallace family library; photographs of Anthony Wallace and his brother David from childhood through adulthood; and Anthony Wallace's World War II scrapbook of photographs from his military service, which includes original photographs of Germany in 1945. The collection also includes Anthony Wallace's scrapbooks and notebooks as well as his writings from childhood through adolescence.</p>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Anthony F.C. Wallace (1923- )</emph> embarked on an anthropological career at a young age as a research assistant to his father, ethnologist and historian Paul A.W. Wallace in the 1930s. After briefly studying at Lebanon Valley College, Anthony enlisted in the U.S. Army, which assigned him to the 14th Armored Division. On American soil for a good portion of his enlistment, the division served in the European Theater and participated in the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp in 1945.</p>
            <p>After his discharge, Wallace began a lifelong association with the University of Pennsylvania's anthropology department, of which he eventually became chair. His initial, somewhat untraditional, choice of undergraduate majors--history and physics--reflected his desire to combine humanistic studies with scientific and technological approaches to the study of man, but the evolutionary perspective of James Frazer's 
                <title render="italic">The Golden Bough</title> later guided him toward the most interdisciplinary of the social sciences--anthropology. Influenced by his father's work and his own interest in Indians, Wallace pursued graduate studies of the Delaware and Tuscarora Indians under the guidance of A. Irving Hallowell, Frank G. Speck, and Loren C. Eiseley, all direct intellectual descendants of Franz Boas. Speck had studied with Boas at Columbia, where Boas taught both Speck and Hallowell in one seminar. Speck and Eiseley, whom Speck had taught at Oberlin and brought to Penn, persuaded Hallowell, their former colleague, to return to Penn after a period at Northwestern. As an heir to the Boasian ethnographic tradition through Speck and Hallowell, Wallace inherited Boas' careful attention to methodology and his interdisciplinary conception of anthropology as encompassing physical, psychological, linguistic, and cultural studies. From his father and Speck, he inherited an interest in the rapidly disappearing cultures of the Northeastern Indians and a personal commitment to his research subjects. Through Hallowell, one of the principal figures in ethnopsychology, he learned to carefully describe behavior and psychological traits while considering the cognitive and emotional structures of his subjects. All of these he synthesized to create a unique blend of ethnology and history influenced by the social, behavioral, and biological sciences, thereby becoming one of the pioneers in the development of ethnohistory as a distinct field.</p>
            <p>At Penn, Wallace earned his BA, MA, and Ph.D. in rapid succession. From men not known to bestow praise lightly, he received glowing recommendations that described him as a brilliant, yet humble, scholar and one of the best anthropology students with whom they had ever worked. Weaving Hallowell's psychological perspective into the study of Indian-white relations, his MA thesis examined the Delaware Indians and their chief Teedyuscung from a psychological, as well as historical, perspective. The work contained the seeds of Wallace's later work on revitalization movements, contrasting the demoralized eastern Delawares who accepted the Christian teachings of Moravian colonists with the more powerful western Delawares who developed a revitalized culture that rejected European influences. Published only a year later, 
                <title render="italic">King of the Delawares: Teedyuscung</title> drew the attention of national publications and garnered largely favorable reviews. Francis Jennings, a frequent critic of Wallace's work, has opined that Wallace allowed theory to influence his presentation of data and that he relied heavily on psychoanalytic theory and biased historical accounts, perhaps overly so. Yet such tendencies often characterize the work of young scholars, as Jennings explains, and in the case of 
                <title render="italic">Teedyuscung</title>, they do not detract significantly from its value as a work of anthropology. He also points out that Wallace's views toward the Quakers, quite harsh in Teedyuscung, later softened; in
                <title render="italic"> Death and Rebirth of the Seneca </title>(1970), he wrote approvingly of the positive teachings and role models presented by the Quaker missionaries.</p>
            <p>For his dissertation, Wallace took his cue from Hallowell, who encouraged his students to use Rorschach tests as a means of studying personality and culture, and Fenton, who had reviewed Hallowell's work and suggested its applicability to the Iroquois, and began an ethnopsychological study of the Tuscarora Indians. Wallace hoped to determine the personality type that occurred most frequently among the Tuscaroras and thereby to study the interaction of personality and culture. Although the modal personality occurred in only 37 percent of the population and thus did not represent the personality of most Tuscaroras, the study provided insight into common personality characteristics found among the Tuscaroras.</p>
            <p>Indian research continued to occupy most of Wallace's time in the 1950s. In addition to an ongoing study of Seneca history and culture that he incorporated into several monographs and books, he devoted much of his free time from 1952 through 1959 to research, consulting, and testifying as an expert witness for legal cases before the Indian Claims Commission. Initially hired by the Joint Efforts Group, led by Felix Cohen, an attorney who initiated reform legislation affecting Indians during the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, Wallace worked for several Indian nations from the eastern Iroquois to the western Sioux. The Justice Department team, headed by Erminie Wheeler Voegelin, included the Marxist anthropologist Harold Hickerson. Most of the cases dealt with the federal government's legal jurisdiction and/or rights to land (or lack thereof) in various Indian nations based on sovereignty granted to the nations in treaties of the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>
            <p>In the midst of his research for the Indian claims, Wallace became indirectly involved in the notorious Joseph McCarthy hearings when McCarthy named Walter Lowenfels, the father of Wallace's assistant Michal Lowenfels Kane, as one of the leading Communists in Philadelphia. Lowenfels, avant garde poet of the 1920s and the editor of the Pennsylvania edition of the Daily Worker, was the oldest of the "Philadelphia Nine," leaders of the local Communist Party arrested and convicted under the Smith Act during a five-month federal trial. Despite her father's troubles and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's refusal to admit her to their library, Kane continued to work with Wallace.</p>
            <p>During this time, he also began nearly twenty years of research on the Seneca Indians that culminated in the publication of 
                <title render="italic">Death and Rebirth of the Seneca</title> (1970), perhaps his best known and most influential work. Originally planned as a biography of the Seneca prophet Handsome Lake, the project expanded into a detailed study of Seneca society, focusing on the prophet's role in "revitalizing" Seneca culture following a tumultuous period of social and cultural change in the late 18th century. After a descent into a personal maelstrom of alcoholism and near-madness that mirrored the turbulence in Seneca society, Handsome Lake underwent a personal transformation in which he experienced a series of visions and revelations. From these, he syncretized traditional Seneca religious beliefs with ideas of individual, social, and agricultural reform inspired by Quaker missionaries into a new religion through which he sought to revitalize his culture much as he had revitalized his personal life.</p>
            <p>Wallace noted similarities between the psychological and physiological changes that accompanied religious inspiration such as Handsome Lake's, psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, and the personality changes associated with stress, social and cultural change, and disasters. Bringing an anthropological perspective to the increasingly accepted psychiatric theory that schizophrenia resulted from a genetic and/or biological predisposition awakened by psychological trauma, Wallace speculated that schizophrenia had both biological and cultural components, a theory he explored in "The Biocultural Theory of Schizophrenia" and "Mental Illness, Biology, and Culture."</p>
            <p>Drawing from biological and cognitive psychological theories, he hypothesized that perhaps similar symptoms could arise in any individual undergoing psychological and physiological stress, a theory that developed into the concept of mazeway resynthesis. He noted that when individuals encounter experiences that challenge the "mazeways" through which they perceive and understand their worlds, their minds often become overwhelmed by conflict, resulting in cognitive dissonance, a state of psychological and (often) physiological turmoil. Applying Hans Selye's concept of general adaptation syndrome to the human mind, Wallace argued that attempting to exist in such discomfort often precipitates physical or mental illness. To resolve such conflicts, individuals must modify their mazeways to accommodate new, formerly troubling, elements, a process he termed "mazeway resynthesis." In more extreme cases involving prophets and psychiatric patients, Wallace believed that the altered physiological milieu resulting from stress engendered not only the process of psychological mazeway resynthesis but also the accompanying visions or hallucinations.</p>
            <p>During this time, Wallace also developed his theory of revitalization movements, which in many ways extrapolates the concept of mazeway resynthesis to the larger society. He described five typical stages, which roughly correspond to the process of mazeway resynthesis, but at the social and cultural level. He theorized that revitalization movements, which he defined as "deliberate, organized, conscious attempts by some or all of the members of a society to construct for themselves a more satisfying culture." were more likely to occur in societies undergoing rapid and/or devastating social change. Most involved prophets who had experienced personal declines similar to that of Handsome Lake, which culminated in psychological states resembling schizophrenia, often accompanied by visions. Following these experiences, the prophets underwent personal transformations, communicated their visions and new insights to others, and synthesized old and new beliefs into new religions or ways of living that revitalized their cultures.</p>
            <p>The intertwining themes of mazeway resynthesis and revitalization movements recurred throughout much of Wallace's work during this time, most notably in the first three books in a series of works that perhaps unintentionally fell into trilogies by subject matter. The first trilogy included 
                <title render="italic">Religion: An Anthropological View, Culture and Personality</title>, and 
                <title render="italic">Death and Rebirth of the Seneca</title>, all of which focused on the psychological, physiological, and cultural aspects of religion, the interaction of personality and culture, and the revitalization of individual personalities as well as cultures. In Religion, he eschewed a strictly critical view of religion in favor of an analytical approach that drew from historical, anthropological, psychological, and physiological sources. He particularly emphasized the ways in which religion and rituals serve as routes through which people achieve a sense of purpose and meaning that most people find difficult to achieve through their daily lives and as means of resolving conflicts that could threaten the existence of their cultures. With the rise of a more scientific and secular society, he foresaw a concomitant waning of institutionalized religious belief and its replacement with a non-deistic philosophy of concern for humanity. 
                <title render="italic">Religion</title> moves beyond ethnological, historical, theological, and psychological theories and provides a thorough examination of the psychological and physiological aspects of ritual and religious belief.</p>
            <p>Wallace's scientific analyses of religious beliefs and experiences, which disavowed supernatural influences and drew parallels between religious inspiration and schizophrenia, may not have endeared him to the more religiously inclined, but they did challenge previously held assumptions with regard to both religion and schizophrenia. Through his examination of the psychological, physiological, and cultural aspects of religious experiences and schizophrenia, Wallace raised vital questions regarding the role of religion in society and scientifically explained the ways in which individuals and societies react to change.</p>
            <p>Breaking with the earlier cultural anthropological tradition of pure ethnographic description without historical context, Wallace advocated studies of cultural evolution that emulated the approach of evolutionary biology. In 
                <title render="italic">Culture and Personality</title>, a scientific and at times quantitative analysis, he examined cultural evolution, the psychology of culture change, and the ways in which cultures provide cognitive frames of reference through which their members perceive and interpret events. . Using the relatively new method of componential analysis, Wallace and other anthropologists such as Floyd Lounsbury and Ward Goodenough used linguistic analysis, particularly in relation to kinship terminology, to study and describe cultures from the perspectives of those cultures rather than the perspectives of Western anthropologists.</p>
            <p>Wallace's interests in anthropology, cognitive psychology, and biology found a home at the Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute (E.P.P.I.) as the federal government and private foundations increased funding for interdisciplinary research in the 1950s and 1960s. As a consultant and later Director of Clinical Research at E.P.P.I., Wallace researched physiological, genetic, social, and cultural aspects of psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia, arctic hysteria (piblokto), and disorders relating to nutritional deficiencies such as hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia. Applying anthropological concepts of linguistics and culture to psychiatric research, his work included studies on the terminology of emotions and the relation of hospital staff consensus to patient disturbance. During this time, Wallace also helped to develop a code of ethics for research with human subjects, following the lead of the National Institute of Mental Health, which in turn had followed guidelines established as a result of the Nuremberg War Crimes trials.</p>
            <p>Through his affiliation with various committees during the 1960s and 1970s, Wallace continued his interdisciplinary work through studies of the psychological effects of disasters and the association between television viewing and social behavior. His influential study Housing and Social Structure, published by the Philadelphia Housing Authority, explored the negative psychological impact of living in high-rise public housing years before widespread popular criticism of such structures. Wallace also presciently argued against the popular psychological conception of homosexuality as a mental illness during the 1960s when he served as a consultant on the National Institute of Mental Health's Task Force on Homosexuality.</p>
            <p>Throughout his years of psychiatric and sociological research, Wallace remained rooted in anthropological modes of analysis while maintaining a strong interdisciplinary perspective. As president of the American Anthropological Association in the early 1970s, he sought to bring related organizations under its umbrella and to resolve ethical conflicts such as the controversy sparked by federal efforts to recruit anthropologists for counterinsurgency missions in politically volatile nations such as Thailand.</p>
            <p>Following the 1970 publication of 
                <title render="italic">Death and Rebirth</title>, Wallace moved away from American Indian studies for several years and turned to the study of technological and social change in white America during the 19th century from an anthropological perspective. This served as the theme of his second trilogy of works, which included 
                <title render="italic">Rockdale, The Social Context of Innovation</title>, and 
                <title render="italic">St. Clair</title>. Inspired by his rural Delaware County, Pennsylvania surroundings, Wallace began to explore the area's history in local historical societies and courthouses, where he found a wealth of information on early 19th century textile mills and Delaware County families. From public records, county histories, and collections of personal papers, he created an evocative portrait of the Rockdale area, which he combined with an analysis of the development of industrialization into the detailed ethnohistorical study 
                <title render="italic">Rockdale: The Growth of an American Village in the Early Industrial Revolution</title> (1978). 
                <title render="italic">Rockdale</title> examined the paternalistic relationship between the evangelical Christian proponents of early industrial capitalism and their employees, their conflicts with freethinking radicals or "infidels," and the ultimate triumph of Christian capitalism in Delaware County, a microcosm of the larger American society. Although one might be tempted to assume that the industrialists cynically dosed their workers with religious opium as a means of subduing incipient labor troubles, Wallace demonstrates through his careful analysis of their words and actions that the textile mill owners and operators did, for the most part, live exemplary lives that reflected their belief in hard work and personal salvation.</p>
            <p>Shortly after completing 
                <title render="italic">Rockdale</title>, Wallace pursued a work that he considered its companion study, one that would study the effects of a less successful model of industrialization in American society. 
                <title render="italic">St. Clair: A Nineteenth Century Coal Town's Experience with a Disaster-Prone Industry</title> (1985) explored how coal operators' disregard of geologists' warnings regarding Pennsylvania coal region geology and their failure to apply new technological innovations led to inefficient mining techniques, poor mine ventilation, and frequent accidents and explosions. Despite a thriving economy fueled by the 19th century demand for coal, the Pennsylvania coal region eventually deteriorated into economic and social disaster, replete with mining accidents, ethnic conflicts, and violence against coal operators and mine supervisors. Financially troubled small coal operators often blamed accidents not on their own failures but on Irish laborers bent on retribution against the mining companies. This developed into the true yet semi-legendary story of the Molly Maguires, whose crimes, trials, and executions became the episodes for which the coal region is perhaps best known. In 
                <title render="italic">St. Clair</title>, Wallace not only analyzed the region's most prominent coal operators and the economists and industrialists who influenced them, but also painted a vivid portrait of life in the coal towns and mine patches. Although 
                <title render="italic">St. Clair</title> lacks some of the warmth and familiarity that characterizes 
                <title render="italic">Rockdale</title>, perhaps because of his relative distance from its subject, as Francis Jennings has noted, Wallace's work remains one of the few detailed and well-researched accounts of Pennsylvania coal region history.</p>
            <p>Between these two massive studies, Wallace sandwiched a shorter study, The Social Context of Innovation (1982), which incorporated his research on the textile industry with his then in-progress study of the coal region. In 
                <title render="italic">Social Context</title>, he described the interrelationship of technology and culture during the Industrial Revolution and the ways in which technological innovation arose from as well as resulted in social change, contrasting the Darby family's successful model of industrialization in Coalbrookdale, England with the unsuccessful examples found in Pennsylvania's coal region.</p>
            <p>The third trilogy of works consisted of 
                <title render="italic">Prelude to Disaster: The Black Hawk War of 1832</title> (1990) 
                <title render="italic">The Long Bitter Trail: Andrew Jackson and the Indians</title> (1993) and 
                <title render="italic">Thomas Jefferson and the Indians: The Tragic Fate of the First Americans</title> (1999), all of which focus on Indian-white relations, and particularly government policy toward the Indians. With these works, Wallace resumed his study of American Indians but with an emphasis on their relations with the United States government and with a more pessimistic flavor than his earlier Indian research. 
                <title render="italic">Prelude to Disaster</title> and 
                <title render="italic">The Long Bitter Trail</title> developed out of Wallace's research for Indian claims cases and examined, respectively, the tragedies of the Black Hawk War and Andrew Jackson's Indian removal policies. Originally published as the introduction to Ellen Whitney's compilation 
                <title render="italic">Introduction to the Black Hawk War, 1831-1832</title>, this brief (51-page) work traces the course of Indian-white relations in Illinois that culminated in the Black Hawk War. 
                <title render="italic">The Long Bitter Trail: Andrew Jackson and the Indians</title> details the misguided and often racist policies that led the federal government to drive the southeastern Indians from their land to reservations in Oklahoma. 
                <title render="italic">Thomas Jefferson and the Indians: The Tragic Fate of the First Americans</title>, his most recent work, explores Jefferson's often-conflicted relationship with the American Indian. Wallace believes that Jefferson viewed the Indians as a noble yet doomed race, whose history and language he sought to preserve while pursuing policies that ultimately would destroy their way of life.</p>
            <p>Since his 1987 retirement, Wallace has remained an active and influential scholar, as evidenced by the three works described above and by his recent talks on the benefits and limitations of local history, which incorporate materials he used for his studies of Rockdale and St. Clair.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                    <p>Series I consists of Anthony F.C. Wallace's correspondence, primarily professional, interspersed with personal letters. Reflecting Wallace's meticulous attention to detail, the correspondence includes almost all outgoing as well as incoming letters. The 2048 correspondents include anthropologists and historians, both professional and amateur; American Indians, government officials, military officers, students, publishers, and readers of his work. Subjects include technological, social, and cultural change; Seneca and Iroquois history and culture; revitalization movements; personality and culture; linguistics; Delaware County history; and Pennsylvania coal region history, the University of Pennsylvania, and psychiatric research, particularly in relation to schizophrenia.</p>
                    <p>Wallace corresponded most extensively with his father Paul, anthropologist William N. Fenton, local historian Merle H. Deardorff of Warren County, Pennsylvania, and Ralph W. Burhoe, founder of 
                        <title render="italic">Zygon</title> and the Institute for the Study of Religion in an Age of Science. Other significant correspondents include his early mentors Frank G. Speck and A. Irving Hallowell and colleagues Francis K. Hsu, Raymond D. Fogelson, and Francis Jennings.</p>
                    <p>The correspondence between Anthony and Paul Wallace, with topics ranging from anthropological and historical research to family matters, provides a rare glimpse into the personal and professional relationship between two generations of an academic family. Spanning the first twenty years of Anthony Wallace's career, the correspondence shows the gradual evolution of Paul and Anthony's relationship from one of father/mentor and son to one of professional colleagues. The family correspondence also includes letters between Anthony and his brother David during World War II and letters from his father Paul A.W. Wallace to other family members, one of which describes the infant Anthony a few days after his birth.</p>
                    <p>The correspondence with Fenton and Deardorff contains detailed discussions of Iroquois history and culture and reflects not only their admiration and respect for one another but also the varied opinions of Iroquoian scholars. Particularly noteworthy examples include Fenton and Wallace's disagreement with regard to the Indian wampum controversy and Deardorff's occasionally sharp and uncompromising criticism of Wallace's work, particularly with regard to his statements regarding Cornplanter's life and family. The Deardorff correspondence, some of which also appears in Series II, also includes intriguing analyses of the lineage and clan memberships of Cornplanter, Handsome Lake, Blacksnake, and others based on their names and references to them and other family members.</p>
                    <p>The extensive correspondence with Ralph Burhoe is not as unlikely as it might initially appear, given Wallace's interests in religion and science. In lengthy and detailed letters, Burhoe discussed Wallace's theories of mazeway resynthesis as applied to religious inspiration and described his own attempts to reconcile religious belief with scientific knowledge, which led to the founding of Zygon and the Institute for the Study of Religion in an Age of Science.</p>
                    <p>The disappointingly spare correspondence with Hallowell reveals little, consisting largely of administrative material relating to the University of Pennsylvania. The letters between Speck and Wallace, although less extensive than one might hope due to their unfortunately short association that ended with Speck's death in 1950, still provide insight into one of Wallace's most influential professional relationships and complement the extensive Speck materials at the APS. Despite a few reservations regarding Wallace's psychological analysis of 
                        <title render="italic">Teedyuscung</title>, the only book-length Wallace work Speck lived to see, Speck's support for Wallace's work shines through in his encouraging and complimentary words regarding an early draft.</p>
                    <p>Hsu's correspondence includes discussions of kinship terminology and linguistic analysis interwoven with personal letters that reveal a warm friendship, with several references to family visits. As might be expected, correspondence with colleagues Fogelson and Jennings include reviews of each other's drafts, some of which appear in the correspondence and elsewhere in the collection. The Jennings correspondence reflects their frequent differences of interpretation</p>
                    <p>Other interesting and noteworthy correspondents include Tuscarora Indian Mina Brayley Smith, whom Wallace met during his research in the late 1940s, Bancha Chittibhol, a student who maintained contact with Wallace after her return to Thailand and sent a great deal of material relating to Thai culture, and Margaret Kint, who described her personal experiences with schizophrenia and became an advocate for research into the biological aspects of schizophrenia.</p>
                    <p>Additional correspondence regarding particular research topics or institutions and committees with which Wallace was affiliated may be found in Series II, VI, VII, VIII, and IX, including additional correspondence with Merle Deardorff, Robert Scherr, and others that Wallace kept with the materials to which it pertained.</p>

                        <p>Notes and drafts from Wallace's research among the Seneca and Tuscarora Indians. Materials include field notes, notes and photocopies from primary and secondary sources, and several issues of the Allegany Reservation newsletter Oh-Ho-Ye-Noh (1970-1972). Although restrictions exist on the Tuscarora Rorschach tests because of the sensitive personal information revealed, the series includes unrestricted censored versions and summary reports as well as the published work 
                            <title render="italic">Modal Personality of the Tuscarora Indians as Revealed in the Rorschach Test</title>.</p>
                        <p>Correspondence that Wallace filed with his notes also appears in Series II A, which includes correspondence with local historian Merle H. Deardorff of the Warren County (Pa.) Historical Society. The Deardorff correspondence contains detailed descriptions of Iroquois (particularly Seneca) history and culture, with thorough discussions and analyses of the lives of Cornplanter, Handsome Lake, and Blacksnake, and other Indians of New York State and Pennsylvania.</p>
                        <p>Related Indian materials appear in Subseries B, Revitalization and Culture; Series III, Bibliographic Notecards, which includes card files of primary and secondary source notes; Series XI, Photographs, which contains Indian reservation photographs taken by Wallace and his father, and in the Paul A.W. Wallace portion of the collection.</p>

                        <p>Materials from Anthony F.C. Wallace's research on the Rockdale area of Delaware County, Pennsylvania, particularly with regard to its mills and industries, but also including extensive information on well known families such as the Smiths and du Ponts. The Rockdale subseries includes notes, extensive photocopies of primary and secondary sources, papers from conferences and talks on Rockdale, Delaware County, and industrialization, student seminar papers related to industrialization and Delaware County history, and the original handwritten manuscript of

                        <p>A unique item also appears with the Rockdale materials: an original 19th century account book from the Sharpless-Worrall company, which apparently supplied mills with raw materials and equipment. Several familiar Delaware County names such as Lammot, Pennell, Willcox, and others appear in the book.</p>
                        <p>Series III, Notecards, contains information on bibliographic sources for 
                            <title render="italic">Rockdale</title> and census data on Rockdale area families. Series XI, Photographs contains over 300 photographs and over 3000 slides of textile mills and machinery and the Rockdale area, a dream collection for historians of industrialization and Delaware County.</p>

                        <p>Materials from Anthony F.C. Wallace's research on the St. Clair, Schuylkill County area of the Pennsylvania coal region, including notes, drafts, photocopies of primary and secondary sources of material relating to Pennsylvania coal region history and detailed analyses of census data for the town of St. Clair, and papers from conferences and talks on St. Clair, Schuylkill County, industrialization, and the role of the hero, particularly as represented by the industrialist, in 19th century America.</p>
                        <p>A valuable central resource for the study of Pennsylvania coal region history, with copies of rare items from repositories and libraries throughout Pennsylvania, the St. Clair subseries contains a wealth of material on coal mining, coal miners and labor organizations, Schuylkill County and Pennsylvania coal region history and the Molly Maguire crimes and trials. In addition to photocopies of most major 19th and 20th century sources on coal region history, arranged by author, the series contains primary source materials culled from several area repositories. These include deeds, correspondence, and other materials from Pennsylvania families as the Wetherills, Careys, and others influential in coal region history as well as notes and correspondence relating to the Pinkerton National Detective Agency's investigation of the Molly Maguires.</p>
                        <p>The St. Clair subseries also includes three linear feet of photocopies of 
                            <title render="italic">Miners' Journal</title> newspaper articles from 1830 to 1878, which Wallace and his wife Betty extracted and arranged by subject, thereby creating an index of sorts for a publication that has no known index.</p>
                        <p>Series III, Notecards, contains additional information on bibliographic sources for St. Clair, census data on St. Clair families, notes on prominent Schuylkill County individuals, and an alphabetical card file of miners injured and killed, which provides a less time-consuming alternative to researching the chronologically-arranged state mine accident reports for St. Clair. Series XI, Photographs, includes over 100 photo reproductions of 19th century prints and photographs depicting coal mining and the Pennsylvania coal region from the Historical Society of Schuylkill County.</p>

                    <p>Although the committee files contain a great deal of routine administrative correspondence, most include reports of interest to those researching American society and culture in the mid to late 20th century. The American Anthropological Association records contain extensive information on the controversy sparked by government efforts to recruit anthropologists for counterinsurgency efforts in politically volatile nations such as Thailand and include several copies of "underground" or independent political publications. The U.S.-U.S.S.R. records include papers by Russian anthropologists and several items published in the Russian language.</p>

                    <p>Materials relating to Anthony F.C. Wallace's affiliation with the Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute (E.P.P.I.) from 1955-1980. The series includes notes and reprints relating to psychiatric research as well as administrative materials and correspondence relating to E.P.P.I.'s Clinical Research Department.</p>
                    <p>The psychiatric research includes material on the physiological, genetic, social, and cultural aspects of psychological disorders, particularly schizophrenia. Material relating to Eskimos and the study of arctic hysteria (piblokto), which shares some similarities with Seasonal Affective Disorder, also comprises a significant portion of the series and includes information on the psychological effects of nutritional deficiencies such as hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia. The series also includes an early paper on premenstrual tension. Although about one-third of the series consists of restricted materials such as tapes and transcripts of personality and family studies conducted at E.P.P.I., the unrestricted portion provides detailed information on the clinical research department of a psychiatric hospital in the mid 20th century as well the relationship between physiological and psychological disorders.</p>

                    <p>Materials relating to Anthony F.C. Wallace's half century of affiliation with the University of Pennsylvania, excluding committee work, which appears in Series VI. Materials include notes and syllabi for courses taken (1946-1950) and taught (1948-1988) by Wallace at the University of Pennsylvania, 1946-1985 and student dissertations for which Wallace served as advisor. Anthropological instructors include Frank G. Speck, A. Irving Hallowell, Theodore Stern, Wilton Krogman, Froehlich Rainey, Loren Eiseley, Frederica de Laguna, and Linton Satterthwaite. Particularly significant are notes for courses taught by Frank G. Speck, as Speck's papers include little material relating to his University of Pennsylvania tenure.</p>

                    <p>Photographs associated with Paul A.W. Wallace's fieldwork among the Indians of Pennsylvania, New York State, and Ontario and Anthony F.C. Wallace's research (1947-1985) on American Indians, industrialization, the Rockdale area of Delaware County, Pennsylvania and the St. Clair area of the Pennsylvania coal region, and Wallace family photograph albums. Original photographs of Indians taken by Paul and Anthony Wallace comprise a relatively small but valuable portion of the series. The bulk of the photographs represent Wallace's Rockdale research, with over 300 photographs and over 3,000 slides of textile mills and machinery and the Rockdale area. A relatively smaller but significant portion of the series consists of photo reproductions of 19th century prints and photographs depicting coal mining and the Pennsylvania coal region from the Historical Society of Schuylkill County.</p>
                    <p>The seven personal and family photograph albums include three family albums with histories written by Paul A.W. Wallace, two written by his father Francis Huston Wallace, and a scrapbook and World War II album compiled by Anthony F.C. Wallace. The photographs include images of Wallace ancestors, homes, and the Wallace family library; photographs of the Paul A.W. Wallace family, including photographs of Anthony Wallace and his brother David from childhood through adulthood; and photographs of the Anthony F.C. Wallace family from the 1940s through the 1960s.</p>
                    <p>The family albums provide a rare glimpse into the personal life of two American scholars as well as a documentation of an American family in the 19th and 20th centuries. The World War II album not only documents the military service of an American soldier, but also graphically depicts the Germany of 1945; subjects include landscapes, bombed buildings, German soldiers, concentration camp ovens and a grisly image of a charred foot.</p>
                    <p>One rare and unusual photograph also appears in the series: a photograph of Albert Einstein with Anthony Wallace's aunt, taken aboard a ship during a trip abroad to renew his passport.</p>

                    <p>Wallace Family papers, Native American Images note : Nearly 4,000 black and white silver gelatin photographs; black and white negatives; pencil and ink sketches; photomechanical prints; news clipping photographs; watercolor paintings; postcards; color slides; and maps of Iroquois tribes of the Six Nations Confederacy, particularly Tuscarora and Mohawk, from 1932-1977. Images represent the research of Paul A. W. Wallace and Anthony F. C. Wallace, father and son anthropologist. Paul’s photograph collection presents traditional ethnographic images of social life and customs: dwellings, ceremonies, utensils, clothing, and individual portraits of Iroquois, with half of the material attributed to Akwesasne Mohawk Ray Fadden (Tehanetorens). Anthony’s ethno-psychological emphasis is displayed in images of arctic hysteria suffered by Inuits and traditions of Tuscaroran culture. Of particular interest, pictographs by Lawrence H. Leder of Robert Livingston Indian records, watercolor paintings by Ray Fadden’s son John, original drawings by Seneca Jesse Cornplanter and Tuscaroran Nellie Gansworth, and tintype and carte de visite portraits. Photographs taken by the Wallaces, except where noted. Images can be found in Paul Wallace’s Correspondence, Series I; Anthony Wallace’s Indian research, Series IIa; Graphic Series and Oversize collection. Oversize maps include Native American linguistic and tribal settlement distributions in northeastern United States and southeastern Canada from 1525-1850. Some references in Freeman’s Guide to manuscripts relating to the American Indian and the manuscript sketch files.</p>
