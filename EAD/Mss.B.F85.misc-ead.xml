            <p>Since publication of I. Minis Hays's Calendar of the Papers of Benjamin Franklin in 1908, the APS Library has acquired a large number of miscellaneous letters and other documents relating to the life, mind, and work of Franklin and his immediate family. The collections listed in this finding aid consist of letters and documents to and from Franklin organized into groupings based upon provenance or focal point. The largest grouping consists of miscellaneous materials acquired individually or in small groups over the years, including a number of important individual items. The other collections consist largely of correspondence between Franklin and individual friends and colleagues, including his friends Mme Brillon, Mary "Polly" Stevenson Hewson, and Catherine Ray Greene, the Whig agriculturist Richard Jackson, and the printer Francis Childs.</p>
            <p>The letters to and from Benjamin Franklin in the miscellaneous collections has been or will be published by the Papers of Benjamin Franklin project. For the most part these materials arrived after I. Minis Hays undertook his project to calendar the 
                <title render="italic">Franklin Papers</title>, and as a result, are not included in that calendar. The current Miscellaneous Collection is the product of the merger of three separate miscellaneous collections previously identified only by differences in call number. The items in each of these miscellaneous collections were originally catalogued in the order received and were assigned a numerical suffix to the basic call number (e.g. B F85.200 or B F85x.1). Although the collection has been rearranged into a single chronological series, we have retained the original call numbers to facilitate comparison to earlier citations.</p>
            <p>The Library has holds reference copies of Franklin correspondence held at Abercairny House, General Registry Office, Edinburgh (correspondence with Henry Homes, Lord Kames), the J. Pierpont Morgan Library, the Harkness Collection at the New York Public Library, and the Bibliothèque Municipale, Mantes, France (duc de La Rochefoucauld). These materials may not be copied without the prior permission of the institution holding the originals.</p>

            <head>Early American History Note</head>
            <p>The Papers of Benjamin Franklin are a rich source as varied and expansive as Dr. Franklin’s storied life. The Collection has been calendared, catalogued, and much of it is available online at franklinpapers.org and in printed volumes. The APS inventory in MOLE is extraordinarily detailed. The aim of this entry is not to reproduce what is already readily accessible, but to focus on material that is unavailable in printed or online sources.</p>
            <p>Most notable are a series of bound volumes that capture different aspects of Franklin’s professional career. The bound volumes include a nearly complete record of the colonial Post Office that Franklin headed, numerous account books from Franklin’s time in England and France, and official account books of the U.S. mission in France. In addition to these bound account and ledger books, the collection also includes a copy of the earliest deed known deed for the Pennsylvania statehouse property, various sketches and drawings thought to be done by Franklin, and four large volumes of a journal of John Lindsay Crawford’s travels with the Russian Army from 1737-1739 that include large maps of Europe that Franklin kept in his library (these four volumes are separately described in MOLE under Crawford).</p>
            <p>The Franklin Papers, along with the papers of his grandsons at the APS, provide a nearly complete picture of Benjamin’s time in France as an American ambassador to France during the American Revolution. Aside from the manuscript records from this period, the collection has a nearly complete set of account books detailing both the official and personal transactions of Franklin in France.</p>
            <p>The APS also houses a collection of books that came from Franklin’s personal library. The library offers insight into Franklin’s own reading and intellectual life. A box of miscellaneous papers in the manuscript collection may also be of related research interest. This box includes a variety of documents that Franklin had in his possession, such as copies of newspapers that have marginalia, that are not included in the official published papers.</p>

                        <p>This is the earliest known surviving Franklin account book. It was kept by Franklin and his wife, Deborah, and very few entries are in other hands. Paper was expensive and ruled books were especially dear: therefore, Franklin used the last half of this volume for Ledger B. "Leidger A" (Journal) is the front half of the book and the entries are records of sales, purchases, printing expenses, bills, etc., under the date of the transaction, and then they were posted under the name of the customer in "Leidger B" (Ledger). Beginning with page 169 the Ledger entries follow, recording individual customers' accounts. There is an eight page index which precedes this Ledger and Franklin, by November 1736 had used all of the pages in the back of the book, so he then used the blank pages between the Journal and the Ledger, and numbered the pages from front to back. Franklin noted that he had cancelled all of the accounts by March 5, 1757, that were either "settled or not like to be recovered." Some of these were "Carried to Ledger E" See: George Simpson Eddy, Account Books Kept by Benjamin Franklin: Ledger 1728-1729, Journal 1730-1737.

                        <p>Franklin, in 1757, appointed his wife's nephew-in-law, William Dunlap, to succeed William Franklin as the Philadelphia postmaster. This volume of ca. 90 written pages lists the letters received at the post office and may well supply a fair picture of the colonial postal system with Philadelphia as a focal point.

                        <p>This volume contains the same kind of entries as "Leidger A" (Journal) and most of the entries herein were made by Deborah Franklin. Since these entries overlap with those in "Leidger A" (Journal), it is sensible to assume that the entries were made in whichever volume proved more convenient at the time, with Franklin more likely to use the Journal and his wife the Shop Book. Most entries appear under date of transaction. From the Shop Book and "Leidgers A &amp; B" a good picture of Franklin's business activities emerges. His printing ventures, goods sold over the counter in the shop and items for his business use or resale give an insight to the struggles to get ahead in the world, for he sold everything from ink and quills to printed legal forms and books.

                        <p>This vellum bound volume, which contains ca.30 pages of writing, was kept by William Temple Franklin for his grandfather, Benjamin Franklin, while they were in France. Benjamin Franklin examined it occasionally and signed it as being correct. These are purely personal expenditures for laundry, dinners, stationery, servants wages, "Paid for Musick (being the Day the Declaration of American Independence was celebrated)" pocket umbrella, books, cords of wood, etc. This is a copy, in part, of No. 22. It is not the account book containing Benjamin Franklin's signature, but his signature is copied on the correct pages.</p>

                    <p>A neighbor of Benjamin Franklin's when he lived at Passy, the French harpsichordist and composer Anne Louise Brillon became an intimate friend. Franklin attended the salon run by Mme Brillon and corresponded with her regularly when they were apart. Her best known composition, "Marche des Insurgents," celebrated the American victory over the British at Saratoga in 1777.</p>

                    <p>The youngest and favorite sibling of Benjamin Franklin, Jane Mecom married the Boston saddler Edward Mecom in 1727. A constant correspondent of Franklin's, Mecom lived out the revolutionary years in Rhode Island (staying with Catherine Ray Greene) and Philadelphia (staying with Richard Bache), where she kept Franklin apprised of current events and public opinion on the course of the war. Mecom bore more than her share of hardships in life. Only nine of her eight sons and four daughters survived infancy, and two of them, including her son Benjamin, went insane in later life.</p>
