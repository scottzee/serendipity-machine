            <head>Early American History Note</head>
            <p>This large collection contains a wealth of information on the Free Quakers, founded in 1781 in Philadelphia. The collection contains records up to the 1970s. The early American materials include minutes, legal documents, receipts, information on burial plots, and membership rolls. There are many documents that date to the Society’s founding, including minutes, but there are many more for the early nineteenth century. Many of the most prominent members of the Society are mentioned, such as Owen Biddle, Bartram Moses, Samuel Wetherhill, Benjamin Say, and John and Elizabeth Claypoole (Betsy Ross). The earliest minutes contain information on the Free Quakers expulsion from the main Quaker meeting (they record being asked to “walk out”) and their formation, which began at the house of Samuel Wetherhill. A letter authored by the women of the Free Society of Friends that contains Elizabeth Calypoole’s name is included in the earliest minutes and what appears to be her signature is part of the Membership Book for 1785. John Calypoole is listed as a regular recipient of Society funds. The financial records contain various donations made by members and the expenditures of the meeting, particularly on the upkeep of their meetinghouse. In addition to the records directly relating to the Society, the collection also has a large collection of currency from the revolutionary era.</p>
