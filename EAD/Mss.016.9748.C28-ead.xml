            <p>This volume contains a series of manuscript essays compiled by Joshua Francis Fisher and presented to the APS in the early 19th Century. It is part of the APS collection of documents relationg to colonial Pennsylvania politics and governance. The first part of the volume has a bibliography made in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century that lists all of the printed pamphlets and other similar documents printed about Pennsylvania from 1681 to 1770. The remaining documents appear to involve the political career and rivalries of William Keith and Andrew Hamilton. The first is an essay “The Life and Character of a strange ‘He Monster,” that is purportedly written by William Keith about Andrew Hamilton. The second and third pamphlets “A Modest Apology” and “A Petition … against the Quakers” were written during Hamilton’s life and involve political controversies he was involved in surrounding defensive measures. The final document is an obituary for Andrew Hamilton.</p>
