Most of the sketches were completed in watercolor during or shortly after the voyage, and include views of Slaughter Landing, Verplank's Point, Stony Point, Dunderberg or Thunder Hill, Haverstraw Bay, Anthony's Nose, and several of West Point.</abstract>

            <p>Charles Willson Peale's Hudson River Sketchbook is a graphic record of the journey to unearth the mastodon skeleton that became the centerpiece of Peale's Philadelphia Museum. The sketchbook includes seventeen watercolor paintings (nine of which span facing pages) and three unfinished sketches in pencil and ink</p>
            <p>The original album is inscribed from Charles Willson Peale to Titian Ramsay Peale, June 1822, and includes brief notes on the mastodon bones, apparently enumerating the bones that had been excavated.</p>
            <p>During the early twentieth century, the sketches were removed from their original binding and laid individually into paper frames before being rebound. The new binding is in blue full-leather with a polychrome morning glory design embossed on the cover, and prints of Charles Willson Peale's portrait of Titian Ramsay Peale (with facsimile signature) and an engraving of Rembrandt Peale's portrait of Charles Willson Peale were inserted at the front. The order of the images as listed below follows their order in the rebound volume.</p>

            <p>On June 18, 1801, Charles Willson Peale and Rembrandt Peale boarded the sloop 
                <emph render="italic">Priscilla</emph> in New York City, bound up the Hudson River for Newburg. Their destination was the Orange County farm of John Masten where the bones of a mastodon were being exhumed -- the mastodon that the Peales purchased and installed as the most popular attraction in their Philadelphia Museum.</p>
            <p>During the voyage to Masten's farm, Peale was overwhelmed by the scenery and began sketching furiously. In a letter to Andrew Ellicott, July 12, 1801, he wrote:</p>
