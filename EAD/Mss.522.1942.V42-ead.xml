            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>During the first half of the nineteenth century, the children of Richard Varley of Hackney, England, grew into a remarkable assortment of artists, scientists, and instrument makers. Descendants of Oliver Cromwell, the five children lost their father in 1791 and were raised by their uncle Samuel who delighted in "Philosophical and Chemical progress," gaining hands-on experience in using and making electrical machines, telescopes, oxygen blow pipes and other scientific instruments. As adults, each of the children shared an abiding interest in art, astronomy, and scientific instrumentation. The eldest son, John (1778-1842) became an important watercolorist, art teacher and astrologer, and the youngest son, William Fleetwood Varley (1785-1856) was a gifted artist who began exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1804. Cornelius Varley (1781-1873) was no less accomplished as a noted watercolor painter, but gained even wider renown as an instrument maker and inventor, specializing in telescopes and miscroscopes.</p>
            <p>The most obscure of the Varley children was Cromwell J. Varley, who evidently shared in the family talents and interests in astronomy and art. At one point he listed himself as an "operative chemist."</p>
