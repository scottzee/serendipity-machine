            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">An electrical engineer, inventor, and entrepreneur, Elihu Thomson was an innovator in electrification in both a technical and corporate sense. With interests that ranged from the technical (electrical meters, high-pressure steam engines, dynamos, generators) to scientific (fused quartz optics, X-rays), Thomson acquired over 700 patents in his career, and in 1882, founded one of the early electrical corporations in the United States, the Thomson-Houston Company, which merged with the Edison Electric Company in 1892 to form the General Electric Company. 
                <lb/>The Thomson Papers are a massive and nearly comprehensive collection documenting the wide range of Thomson's scientific and technical interestsm from his electrical experiments, inventions, and patents, to his interests in astronomy, geology, and medicine, as well as his role in the development of two major corporations involved in electrification, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company and General Electric Company. Roughly three quarters of the collection is dated between 1890 and 1920 when Thomson was associated with General Electric, and was active in professional groups such as the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), International Electrotechnical Commission. His research interests. The balance of the collection is comprised of eight boxes and five volumes relating to Thomson's patents; a series of notebooks kept at Central High School; 43 letterbooks, 1882-1936; diaries of trips to Europe; notebooks on genealogy; scrapbooks of cards, photographs, clippings, and other souvenirs; and 2 vols. of tributes on his eightieth birthday, etc.</abstract>

            <p>The Thomson Papers were assembled from the various accessions received from his widow, General Electric, and Thomson's colleagues. Some, but not all of this activity is documented in Series XV; additional information can be found in the Planning Report written by Bernard Carlson, in the APS Legal File, which may be requested from the Manuscripts Librarian. The collection was first given the call number B T384, but was reorganized under the call number Ms. Coll. 74.</p>
            <p>A few parts of the collection were cataloged in great detail by Gertrude Hess and other staff members of the APS, but for the most part, except for Bernard Carlson's devoted attention to the papers, they remained unprocessed and unusable until 1992, when the collection was removed from its scattered storage sites within the building and reunited under a new call number. Under the supervision of first Elaine McCluskey, then Miriam Spectre and finally Beth Carroll-Horrocks, Library volunteer Charles J. Fitti processed the two correspondence series. Robin Klein reprocessed the correspondence series in 2004-2005.</p>

            <p>The Thomson Papers have come to the APS Library in many accessions. The first group of papers were donated by Thomson's second wife, Mrs. Clarissa Hovey Thomson, after his death in 1937. Soon after, Owen D. Young, Chairman of the Board of General Electric, had Thomson's office files from the Lynn, Massachusetts plant transferred to the APS. Additional material was collected from Thomson's colleagues. Researchers interested in the history of the creation of this collection at the APS Library should see Series XV for further information.</p>
            <p>In March of 1985, a second major accession from General Electric came to the APS Library. Approximately 3.5 linear feet, this material was sent from the G.E. Hall of History Foundation in Schenectady, New York. Prior to 1982, the papers had been housed in Thomson's personal office at the West Lynn (Massachusetts) plant. When the West Lynn plant was sold in 1982, the papers were transferred to the G.E. Hall of History. It appears that this second General Electric accession includes material pulled from the papers sent to the APS in 1937-38, due to proprietary interest held by G.E. at that time.</p>
            <p>In September of 1980, W. Bernard Carlson of the University of Pennsylvania organized a conference at the APS in which the Thomson Papers were discussed and a planning report for their future arrangement and use was produced. Carlson used the collection heavily for his dissertation at the University of Pennsylvania (entitled 
                <emph render="italic">Invention, Science, and Business: The Professional Career of Elihu Thomson, 1870-1900, </emph>1984). Carlson subsequently developed this dissertation into a biography (
                <emph render="italic">Innovation as a Social Process: Elihu Thomson and the Rise of General Electric, 1870-1900, </emph>Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1991).</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The Elihu Thomson Papers (1853-1955) contain correspondence, subject files, manuscripts of published and unpublished works, speeches, notebooks, sketches, photographs, certificates, clippings, scrapbooks, and memorabilia which document Thomson's career as an inventor, electrical engineer, and entrepreneur. Thomson's original birth certificate from Manchester, England, is the earliest piece of the collection (1853). Some of the most recent items of the collection, primarily memorial pieces written by Thomson's colleagues and friends, date well after his death in 1937.</p>
            <p>The collection spans Thomson's lifetime, with a significant amount of material dating from his high school years in Philadelphia, through his mid-career, and into his final years of retirement in Swampscott, Massachusetts. Thomson's many achievements in the development of late 19th and early 20th century technology as well as his involvement in the growth of the Thomson-Houston companies and the General Electric Company are the primary subjects of this collection.</p>
            <p>The correspondence of Series I and II give a full understanding of Thomson's success in presenting his ideas on electricity, astronomy, physics, lightning, fused quartz, scientific education, investments, and patents. Thomson was a remarkably focused person who knew clearly that he was not interested in business administration or management and so removed himself from those elements as they developed from his scientific ideas and inventions. Thomson's work for the General Electric Company, through a combination of his ideas and the enormous professional respect he gained, was done on Thomson's own terms. He apparently did very much as he pleased, and was pleased first to be a scientist.</p>
            <p>Thomson had a life-long reputation for kindness, honesty, good manners and charm, although the papers also reveal a kind of curtness in his early years. The papers reflect his privileged status among the corporate, professional and academic leaders of his time. It is not always clear where his activities were GE-related rather than simply the activities of Elihu Thomson the electrical engineer, the scientist, the professional. Added to this, the GE Company itself and Thomson and his professional peers apparently worked without clear boundaries as to where personal/professional interests and corporate interests started and stopped. They wrote about "personal" scientific questions on company letterhead and of course used informal names for professional celebrations, meetings, and congresses.</p>
            <p>Consequently, keeping Series I (Professional Correspondence) and II (General Electric Company Correspondence) compartmentalized was a formidable task. These two series must be used together to gain a complete picture of Thomson's life and work, and they also serve as a "mortar," the subjects covered binding together all the other series.</p>
            <p>The papers of Series III-XV offer a wide range of topics relating to Thomson's long life and career. His involvement in the development of early electric light and power systems, the growth of the modern research industry, the building of individual businesses, and the professionalization of engineers and their academic institutions is documented in the collection. Detailed information on Thomson's many inventions and patents is preserved through sketches, blueprints, photographs, notebooks, and manuscript comments. These documents involve early dynamos, three-phase generators, electric welding, transformers, meters, lamps, and steam engines. Besides information on Thomson's inventive process, researchers will also find material of note regarding his interests in astronomy, x-rays, and fused quartz optics.</p>
            <p>The papers are divided into fifteen series:</p>

            <p>Elihu Thomson (1853-1937) was an electrical engineer, inventor, business man, and entrepreneur who figured prominently in the development of early electric light and power systems in the United States. During a long career which spanned the 19th and 20th centuries, Thomson acquired over 700 patents involving dynamos, three-phase generators, repulsion induction motors, electric welding, transformers, meters, lamps, railways, and steam engines. Thomson was responsible for pioneering research in alternating currents and high frequency, as well as the first safety standards for electrical work. Additional studies in astronomy, refracting telescopes, optics, and x-rays enhanced his industrial research. Besides his achievements in early electric technology, Thomson made considerable contributions to the professionalization of engineers through his active involvement in organizations such as the Franklin Institute, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and the International Electrical Congress.</p>
            <p>Elihu Thomson was born in Manchester, England on 29 March 1853 to Daniel Thomson and Mary Ann Rhodes Thomson. In 1858, the Thomson family moved to the United States and settled in Philadelphia. At the age of thirteen, Thomson entered Philadelphia's Central High School. Upon graduation in 1870, Thomson was offered a position with the school as an instructor in physics. By 1876, he was honored with the chair in chemistry.</p>
            <p>In 1880, Thomson resigned from his professorship to enter the electric industry. He moved to New Britain, Connecticut to accept a position as an electrician with the American Electric Company. While employed with American Electric, Thomson developed his electric lighting system and formed the Thomson-Houston Company in 1882. In 1883, the Thomson-Houston works moved to Lynn, Massachusetts, where the great development of Thomson's electric company took place throughout the 1880s. The Thomson-Houston Electric Company merged with the Edison Electric Company of Schenectady, New York to form the General Electric Company in 1892. Major off-shoots of this company grew in Germany, France, and England and helped spread throughout Europe an electric lighting system based on Thomson's patents. Thomson's work was not restricted to the electric manufacturing business; he acted as president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1920 to 1923.</p>
            <p>Thomson married his first wife, Mary Louise Peck, in 1884. They had four children: Stuart, Roland Davis, Malcolm, and Donald Thurston Thomson. His first wife died in 1916, and in 1923 he married Clarissa Hovey. Elihu Thomson died on 13 March 1937 after a long illness at his home in Swampscott, Massachusetts.</p>

                    <p>Arranged chronologically, contains materials related to the General Electric Company, but also material concerning the Thomson Houston Electric co., the Welding Co., patents (which were a GE interest) and letters or documents by persons not employed by GE but who somehow contributed to the work of GE. Documentation of scientific clubs by or for GE employees are also in this series, and also correspondence about GE publications. Since Thomson was so often consulted by other scientists and laypersons, it is difficult to distinguish between his work as a GE employee and his "personal" interests, often documented in letters addressed to him (and certainly answered by him) at his GE addresses. Series II also documents cases where the GE Company expressed a direct interest in technical or scientific institutions, meetings, trade congresses, technical terminology, acts of the U.S. Congress, and educational institutions.</p>
                    <p>Series I and II are accompanied by an index card file that has undergone several procedural changes since it was begun by APS librarians soon after the arrival of the collection. It began as a highly-detailed, item-level catalog for a portion of the letters that are now distributed between the two series, but that level of cataloging was impossible to maintain, and since one series is arranged alphabetically and the other chronologically, it is usually possible for researchers to use the two series together to find correspondents and then specific topics. The card file is also very useful for matching individual correspondents to their affiliated institutions, and since many of the cards contain a one-sentence snopsis of the contents they can help direct researchers to specific dates or correspondents.</p>

                    <p>Along with Thomson's incoming business correspondence, GE presented to the APS most of Thomson's outgoing business correspondence. Series IIA contains 43 large volumes, of which 28 are letterpress copybooks with hundreds of tissue paper pages while the remaining volumes are bound carbon copies of letters. Thirty-six of the letterbooks form one unbroken series extending from 1887 to 1936, while seven other letterbooks cover various periods from 1882 to 1890. Approximately six of the early volumes (1883-1890) contain only patent applications, interference briefs, and correspondence with the Patent Office. It appears that the series contains nearly all of the letters Thomson wrote while associated with Thomson-Houston and General Electric and perhaps most of the letters related to the American Electric Company.</p>
                    <p>The early letterpress copy books, especially the patent correspondence volumes, contain copies of Thomson's handwritten letters and notes. Around 1885 Thomson acquired a secretary and a typewriter, so most of the subsequent letters were dictated and typed. Unfortunately, because the chemical transfer process used in the letterpress copybooks occasionally worked poorly, some letters in these volumes are faint. Also, since the bindings of most of the volumes have deteriorated badly, and since the numbering system(s) for the volumes has been inconsistent, researchers should rely on the volume list provided by Charles Fitti, which follows later in this finding aid. Also, please note that Mr. Fitti took as a sample Volume 46 to test the amount of duplication between the documents preserved in the letterbooks and the letters in Series I and Series II. He found that of the 800 pages 30% were duplicated in either Series I or II (10% in Series I; 20% in Series II). Those percentages may vary in other volumes.</p>

                    <p>Material dating primarily from Elihu Thomson's years at Central High School in Philadelphia through the end of his life, although there are several files collected by his wife which date after his death in 1937. The series is arranged alphabetically by subject. Files consist of a variety of materials, such as legal documents, reports, specifications on inventions and patents, blueprints, programs for scientific meetings and events, and miscellaneous manuscript data relating to Thomson's industrial research and personal interests.</p>
                    <p>Subjects files hold much information regarding Thomson's inventions as well as his studies in astronomy, optics, and x-rays. Many of Thomson's early legal agreements relating to the development of the Thomson-Houston electric companies and the use of his patents have been preserved in this series. These documents trace the growth of Thomson's business concerns and his affiliation with early electric lighting companies such as the American Electric Company. Information on Thomson's involvement with many professional societies for electrical engineers and scientists is available throughout many of the subject files; as an active member of the Franklin Institute, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Thomson collected much material on their meetings and events.</p>

                    <p>Autograph and typescript drafts, notes, comments, and printers' page proofs. Printed articles, journals, reprints, and photostats have been moved to the Thomson Reprint Collection. Title pages or first pages of this printed material were photocopied onto acid-free Permalife bond paper and included in the manuscript files before the printed material was transferred to the reprint collection. The only printed materials not removed from Series IV are several ephemeral pieces which are extremely fragile due to age.</p>
                    <p>Manuscripts of Thomson publications are arranged alphabetically by title, and focus on his lifelong interests in electrical systems, welding, astronomy, optics, etc. Many facets of Thomson's professional career and inventions are documented throughout the series. The manuscripts date from Thomson's first published article, "The Triumphs of Science" in his high school paper (1869), to the works published towards the end of his career. Besides manuscripts of papers prepared for publication in scientific journals, this series also contains manuscript drafts of Thomson's many editorial pieces published in both newspapers and journals throughout the country.</p>
                    <p>Comments by Thomson appear on separate sheets and on the actual manuscripts and evaluate the historical importance of many publications. It appears he was making these notes to a future editor of his biography/bibliography.</p>

                    <p>School papers, autobiographical essays, poetry, short papers on ideas and inventions, and any works which were not identified as published. These manuscripts are arranged alphabetically by title and date from Thomson's high school years to the end of his life.</p>
                    <p>Among the many high school papers preserved in this series, probably of most interest is the "Universal Journal." Produced by the Junior Scientific and Literary Society of Central High School in Philadelphia, this journal is primarily written in Thomson's longhand. Other manuscripts of interest in this series include the many short, anecdotal papers written by Thomson about his childhood in Philadelphia and the origins of his studies in the sciences. While most of these papers are autograph manuscripts, some appear to have been dictated to and typed by Thomson's second wife, Clarissa Hovey Thomson. A great deal of these autobiographical papers must have been used by David O. Woodbury in the biography,

This series holds manuscript material both published and unpublished, including papers, reports, journal articles, speeches, and radio addresses. A large portion of the series is biographical, produced by Thomson's friends and colleagues after his death and originally stored in two boxes labeled "Biographical Material." The complete, original manuscript of David O. Woodbury's biography, 
                        <emph render="italic">Elihu Thomson, Beloved Scientist </emph>(1944), is preserved in this series as well.</p>
                    <p>Also of interest are several manuscript and typescript translations of historical works in the field of optics. Produced for Thomson's friend and fellow amateur telescope maker George Wattson Hewitt by Florence C. and Emil P. Albrecht, these translations date ca. 1901 and focus on the works of S. Czapski, J.J. Littow, and L. Schuppmann.</p>

                    <p>Thomson's high school notebooks from classes taken as a student, some industrial research notebooks, genealogy notebooks, and trip journals. Notebooks are arranged alphabetically by subject, although the folder title does not reflect 
                        <emph render="italic">all </emph>the information located in the notebook. Many notebooks contain miscellaneous, random notes regarding other topics. Often these notebooks were labeled on the front cover by Thomson, including his evaluations as to the historical significance of the contents.</p>
                    <p>Notebooks often appear in a journal or diary page format, although they were not necessarily used as such; often volumes printed as journals were used as notebooks, with no apparent connection between printed dates on pages and manuscript notes. In many cases, blank pages remain throughout the volumes. Miscellaneous diagrams and sketches appear within the text of the manuscript notes. Some of the journals documenting Thomson's travels contain additional notes in the hand of Clarissa Hovey Thomson, his second wife and traveling companion during the later years of his life.</p>

                    <p>Primarily pencil sketches of inventions and mechanical apparatus on individual sheets of assorted shapes, sizes, and types of paper. For the most part, sketches remain in Thomson's original order, as found in his filing cabinets. These sketches are arranged alphabetically by general subject headings and then chronologically within each file. In many cases, these sketches are only identified by date, without any other description. For this reason, they remain under Thomson's general subject headings, as they have not been identified any further. Other individual sketches are filed by subject when they have been identified. Occasional Thomson manuscript notes on specifications for patents appear on the sketches.</p>
                    <p>Several files of sketches by E.W. Rice, Jr., fellow inventor and business associate of Thomson, exist in a general chronological arrangement; most of these sketches are not identified by subject, but were found within a file labeled with Rice's name. Many of these sketches seem to have Thomson's manuscript notation on them and suggest collaboration between the two. Other sketches which appear to have been executed in conjunction with colleagues are identified by various signatures and initials.</p>

                    <p>Thomson's manuscript comments and notes on his patents. Originally bound in five volumes, comments are now arranged chronologically (by date patent was issued) on individual 8" x 10" sheets of paper. Each patent comment appears on a single page which has been laminated with Japanese tissue and is filed in a separate folder. Patents have been assigned identifying numbers which appear at the top of each patent comment and on a typescript list which duplicates the chronological arrangement of the series. This list is located in Box 1, Folder 1. Folders 2-4 in Box 1 contain typescript versions of the manuscript patent comments, and also follow the same chronological arrangement of the series (these typescripts exist for "vols. II-V;" "vol. I" is missing).</p>
                    <p>In these patent comments, Thomson describes and evaluates each invention, often detailing the slight variations and improvements in newer versions. Thomson continued to work on some devices for years; consequently, he held many patents for mechanical apparatus such as dynamos, electric lighting systems, meters, and lamps. Initials at the top of each patent comment sheet appear to refer to the individuals, often besides Thomson, who worked on the patent. Edwin J. Houston and E.W. Rice, Jr. most often appear as collaborators on these inventions.</p>
                    <p>Only three patent certificates issued to Thomson by the United States Patent Office have been preserved in this collection. They date ca. 1879 and are filed in Series XII, Certificates.</p>

                    <p>Black and white photographs in various sizes, organized alphabetically by subject or last name and then chronologically within each file. Besides early 20th century prints, several 19th century formats exist in this series as well, including albumen and cyanotype prints. Dates on the folders often reflect the date of the image, not when the photograph was taken, as this was sometimes the only date recorded on the photograph. Negatives can be located in this series as well; if a negative exists within a folder, [neg.] has been indicated after the folder title.</p>
                    <p>Photographs are often those of Thomson, family members, professional associates, events, and places. Many photographs of Thomson's inventions and miscellaneous mechanical apparatus are filed in this series as well. A typed description of the device often appears on the photograph, with a date reflecting the year of invention, not when the photograph was taken. Other photographs of interest include those taken by Thomson as a hobby.</p>

                    <p>Individual clippings arranged alphabetically by subject and scrapbooks of collected clippings (#1-4). Clippings have been photocopied onto acid-free Permalife bond paper; copies were filed and original clips were discarded due to brittleness. Topics of clippings include obituaries (of Thomson and colleagues), wedding announcements for Thomson's second marriage, and miscellaneous biographical information on Thomson and his career.</p>
                    <p>Scrapbooks primarily contain newspaper clippings, although a small amount of memorabilia and photographs exists within the scrapbooks as well. Some of the clippings in these scrapbooks are duplicates of individual clippings which have been filed by subject. For the most part, the scrapbooks follow a general chronological arrangement. For conservation purposes, these scrapbooks will be microfilmed in the future.</p>

                    <p>Comprised of two subseries. Subseries A contains correspondence generated during the APS Library's attempt to collect Thomson letters from his colleagues after his death. It was the intention of those involved to create the most complete collection of Thomson papers possible; this meant writing to a great many prominent scientists and engineers across the country, asking them to donate any Thomson letters they may have received from him during his lifetime. Major correspondents of this series include Gertrude D. Hess, Assistant Librarian of the APS; Clarissa Hovey Thomson, widow; Roland S. Morris, APS President; Owen D. Young, Chairman of the Board of the General Electric Company; and John A. McManus, Thomson's longtime secretary at General Electric. Correspondence has been placed in five file folders and remain in its original, semi-chronological arrangement.</p>
                    <p>Subseries B holds inventories of manuscripts which were produced as the papers were donated. Several of these inventories record the various shipments of papers as they were received from Thomson's widow at their home in Swampscott, Mass. Other inventories were created as the initial processing of the professional correspondence occurred ca. 1937-38.</p>
                    <p>Both the correspondence and inventories of Series XV offer a great deal of information on the provenance and initial organization of the Thomson Papers at the APS Library.</p>
