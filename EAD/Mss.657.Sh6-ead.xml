            <p>Joseph Shippen (1706-1793) was a merchant. The Shippen family was one of the most prominent families in eighteenth and nineteenth century Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>Joseph Shippen was the third of seven children of Joseph Shippen and Abigail Grosse. His father was a founding member of Benjamin Franklin’s Junto, an association of young men established “for mutual information and public good.” His brothers were the merchant and judge Edward (1703-1781, APS 1769) and the physician William (1712-1801), often referred to as William Shippen, the Elder. His sister Anne (1710-1790) was married to the merchant Charles Willing (1710-1754), mayor of Philadelphia and one of the founders of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p>In 1742, Joseph Shippen, who went in the family by the name of “Gentleman Joe,” was elected to the Philadelphia City Council in which he served for many years. He subsequently moved to Germantown, where he died. Shippen was married to Mary Kearney of Barbados. They had eight children.</p>
