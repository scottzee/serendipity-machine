            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">A long-time member of the faculty at Johns Hopkins, the biochemist William Mansfield Clark made significant contributions to the understanding of oxidation-reduction potentials of organic systems. This collection of Clark's professional papers includes drafts of manuscripts and correspondence, especially with James B. Conant and Barnett Cohen, relating to Clark's life and research. Of particular note are Clark's Cutter lectures at Harvard in 1930 and his correspondence with Eric G. Ball, when Ball worked in Otto Warburg's lab in Berlin in 1937-1938. Clark's participation in professional organizations is reflected in correspondence with the Society of American Bacteriologists and with the Journal of Biological Chemistry, as well as with colleagues Stanley Benedict and Rudolph Anderson. There is some material relating to Clark's lectures and papers, and there are four student notebooks (physical chemistry, optics, thermodynamics/physics), and twenty-three miscellaneous scientific notebooks, 1941-1953.</abstract>

            <head>Physiology, Biochemistry, and Biophysics Note</head>
            <p>William Mansfield Clark headed the Department of Physiological Chemistry at the Johns Hopkins Medical School from 1927 to 1952, where he developed a major research program in physical biochemistry, centering around oxidation-reduction potentials of organic systems, research that required precise measurements and sensitive instruments. The Clark Papers contain material relating to his lectures and papers, twenty-four notebooks (1941-1953), ten files on his associate Barnett Cohen (1910s-1950s) that include extensive data on dyes, and two photograph files containing pictures of his laboratory, the "Temple of pH." There are also four student notebooks (physical chemistry, optics, thermodynamics/physics), which together with the correspondence, form a rich record on laboratory practice and training in physical biochemistry.</p>
            <p>Before coming to Johns Hopkins, Clark had worked in bacterial chemistry at the United States Department of Agriculture and in the United States Public Health Service, where he was made chief of the Division of Chemistry of the Hygienic Laboratory. A few files (records dated before 1927) contain information on the practice of biochemistry and microbiology within federal bureaus.</p>
            <p>Clark's career, as seen from his papers, exemplifies the disciplinary evolution from medical chemistry to biochemistry. As the founders of American biochemistry sought to liberate their field from a clinical service role, they increasingly allied it with the physical sciences; Clark's skills in physical biochemistry -- his hydrogen ion determinations, and his studies of buffers and salts in connection with bacterial fermentation--were well suited to the new orientation.</p>
            <p>During his tenure at Johns Hopkins, Clark assumed leadership of his profession. He was on the editorial board of the Journal of Biological Chemistry and served as president of both the Society of American Bacteriologists and the American Society of Biological Chemists.</p>

The most valuable part of the correspondence are the letters written from Europe when Ball was on sabbatical leave in 1937-1938. Most of the letters are about Otto Warburg's laboratory at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, where Ball was working on determinations of oxidation-reduction potentials in the cytochrome system. These letters offer a wealth of information on the physical aspects of the laboratory, social interactions, and Warburg's personality. There are also descriptions of Ball's stay at the Harnack-Haus and his reaction to the political scene in Germany. Also reveal episodes and attitudes (including anti-Semitism) related to the intellectual migration.)</emph> </entry>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>A pioneer in the field of biochemistry, William Mansfield Clark (1884-1964) was born on August 17, 1884, the only son of Caroline Scoville Hopson (1840-1928) and James Starr Clark (1822-1914), an Episcopal minister from Tivoli Township, New York. The Clarks endowed William and his sisters Margaret, also known as "Daisy" (who later married the biologist Francis B. Sumner), and Anna with an exceptional education. William Clark was first educated first at the Trinity School, which his father had founded and administered, and after receiving a scholarship, he graduated from the Hotchkiss School in 1903. At Williams College, he studied under Leverett Mears, and received a B.A. and M.A. in 1907 and 1908 respectively, before moving to Johns Hopkins as a student of Harmon Morse. Clark received his PhD in 1910 for a dissertation entitled, "A Contribution to the Investigation of the Temperature Coefficient of Osmotic Pressure: A Redetermination of the Osmotic Pressures of Cane Sugar Solutions at 20°." While at Hopkins, Clark spent his summers at the recently established chemistry laboratory at Wood's Hole, Mass., where he served as the assistant to Carl Alsberg and later, Donald D. Van Slyke.</p>
            <p>Clark's first professional position came as a research chemist with the Dairy Division of the Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of Agriculture, working under the direction of Lore A. Rogers. Before he resigned in June 1920, Clark worked on a variety of problems in dairy bacteriology, and, with his colleague Herbert A. Lubs, started studies in hydrogen-ion concentration. It was through these studies that Clark and Lubs developed and defined the concept of pH, resulting in Clark's seminal book, 
                <title render="italic">The Determination of Hydrogen Ions</title> (1920, 1923, 1928). H. B. Vickery writes of the book, "[it] brought about what amounted to a revolution in bacteriological laboratories and exerted a profound influence upon all aspects of biochemistry where the measurement and control of acidity are matters of importance."
                <ref target="ref3">
                    <emph render="super">1</emph></ref></p>
            <p>Remaining in the government service, Clark took a position at the Hygiene Laboratory of the U.S. Public Health Service in July, 1920, where he remained until 1927. As had been the case at the Dairy Division, Clark was given wide latitude in pursuing his research interests, which, as Clark himself wrote, increasingly focused "in measurements of oxidation-reduction potentials and their systematic formulation."
                <ref target="ref3">
                    <emph render="super">2</emph></ref> Clark and others undertook the reporting of their findings in a series of papers entitled, "Studies on Oxidation-Reduction," many of which were co-authored with his long-time friend and colleague Barnett Cohen. The first of these articles was published in 1923, the last, number 24, in 1956.</p>
            <p>Clark continued his research into oxidation-reduction potentials when he accepted an appointment as DeLamar Professor of Physiological Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. During his 25 years at Hopkins, from 1927 to 1952, Clark expanded his research program into ligand and metalloporphyrin systems, and he developed the concept of a "chemical continuum." In addition to laboratory research, he carried a full load of teaching and administrative responsibilities.</p>
            <p>By all accounts, Clark was much respected as both a teacher and administrator. His desire to provide his medical students with a proper background in chemistry led him to write the enormously successful textbook, 
                <title render="italic">Topics in Physical Chemistry</title> (1948, 1952). Clark clearly valued his teaching duties, writing, "[t]houghtful easement of the acquirement of knowledge is an essential part of the economics and of the aesthetics of education. It should not be regarded as less than among the tougher of intellectual jobs."
                <ref target="ref3">
                    <emph render="super">3</emph></ref> In addition to teaching, writing, and conducting research, Clark served on the editorial board of the 
                <title render="italic">Journal of Biological Chemistry</title> from 1933 until 1952.</p>
            <p>During World War II, Clark served as chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, National Research Council; was a consultant to both the Committee on Medical Research of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, and the National Defense Research Committee; was chair, and later a member, of the Committee on Biological Warfare, National Academy of Sciences; a member of the Committee on Quartermaster Problems, National Academy of Sciences; and a member of the National Academy of Sciences Council. Among the more important developments emerging from Clarks's frenzied wartime activity was the testing and development of antimalarial agents for the U.S. military. As a member of the Board for the Coordination of Malaria Studies, Clark was heavily involved in testing the most successful agent of the time, quinacrine, and in searching for new antimalarial compounds.</p>
            <p>In 1952, Clark retired from Hopkins and was appointed DeLamar Emeritus Professor and Research Professor of Chemistry. Succeeded as the DeLamar Professor by Albert Lehninger, Clark moved from his laboratory at the medical school to one on the university's Homewood campus, where he continued his research, while maintaining a regular schedule of publication and teaching. His last book, 
                <title render="italic">Oxidation-Reduction Potentials of Organic Systems</title>, appeared in 1960. Clark was working on a revision at this book, an exhaustive survey of research in the field, at the time of his death in Baltimore on January 19, 1964. He was survived by two daughters, Harriet Allen (Mrs. Everett B. Gladding) and Miriam Clark, from his marriage, on 14 September 1910, to Rose Willard Goddard (d. 1958).</p>
            <p>Clark received a number of honors and awards during his career, including election to the National Academy of Sciences (1928) and the American Philosophical Society (1939); election as President of the Society of American Bacteriologists and of the American Society of Biological Chemists (1933 and 1934); and selection for the Cutter Lectures on Preventive Medicine (1930), as Harvey Lecturer (Fall 1933); and as Remsen Memorial Lecturer (1952). He received honorary degrees from Williams College (1935) and the University of Pennsylvania (1940), and was awarded the William H. Nichols Medal of the New York Section, American Chemical Society (1936), the Borden Award (1944); the President's Certificate of Merit (1948); the Passano Award (1957); and the Award of Merit of the Maryland Section, American Chemical Society (1963).</p>

                    <p>Research notes, notebooks, and calculations made by Clark in the course of laboratory work, and the writing of manuscripts intended for publication. Also included are six folders of material containing "data on dyes." These folders include notes and calculations made by Clark and Barnett Cohen, and seem to date from 1927-1951. Correspondence found with this material, largely between Cohen and others, has been photocopied. The photocopies remain in Series III, while the originals were moved to Series I. Other material (ca. 1960's) concerns work on indophenols, and papers published by Clark's one-time student, and later professor of biochemistry at Yale University, Henry Harbury. Harbury's articles, co-authored with Paul A. Loach, detail aspects of heme peptides, and ligand systems. Also included is material regarding work by John Gryder. In addition, this series contains seven notebooks which relate to Clark's class work, and to his lab on Hopkins' Homewood campus. The class notebooks include notes on optics, physical chemistry, and physics and thermodynamics. Notebooks regarding the Homewood lab (ca. 1953) include the following: "Calibrations &amp; Standards", "Miscellaneous Experiments, Oct. 1953", and "Preparations." Other items in this series include a book of personal accounts (1907-1911), and 16 engagement books (Nov. 1941-June 1947) which cover the period of Clark's involvement with U.S. Government programs during World War II.</p>

                    <p>Handwritten manuscripts, typescripts, and one transcript, which chiefly comprise conference reports and papers describing research. A good portion of the material in this series resulted from the National Academy of Sciences / National Research Council antimalarial drug program. Papers covering other subjects were authored by Jonas S. Friedenwald, Karl Sollner, Joseph and Dorothy Moyle Needham, and R. E. Tarbett. The Friedenwald papers, three in number, concern the elementary theory of enzymatic activity and were co-authored with Gertrude Maengwyn-Davies. Also included is a 1952 manuscript by John Fuller Taylor entitled, "Wm. Mansfield Clark - An Appreciation." There is other biographical information about Clark to be found in notes by Donald D. Van Slyke and A. Baird Hastings. Two other items of note are humorous in nature. First, a handwritten manuscript by R. Keith Cannan entitled, "Studies on Ectoplasm...," and a printed sheet entitled, "The Turbo-Encabulator."</p>

                    <p>Black and white photographic prints and negatives, and one 8mm color movie (1 reel; unidentified subject). The bulk of the prints show Clark's laboratory at the Johns Hopkins University Medical School, and include both staff members, and lab apparatus. There are also prints marked U.S.D.A. and labeled "Potassium Indigotine," a photo of a galvanometer, a photo of a portrait of Edwards A. Park, and miscellaneous images which include one of a large group of people (perhaps family members) gathered around a dinner table, and of the Czechoslovakia pavilion at a World's Fair. A large print (ca. 8" X 34"), now in several pieces, shows a group of people posed in front of a building, perhaps at the Johns Hopkins University Medical School or a U.S. Government facility. Clark and Barnett Cohen are close to the center of this print. The negatives, all of which are 4" X 5" show lecture or class notes on blackboards. The first group of 17 negatives was labeled "carbohydrates," and the second group of 9 negatives, "introduction and fats (I)." A photo (8" X 10") of a commemorative memento for the fiftieth anniversary of the American Physiological Society is also included.</p>
