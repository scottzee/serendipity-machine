            <p>Charles Willson Peale was an artist and naturalist. Peale's Museum (also called the Philadelphia Museum) was the first to be scientifically organized and open to the American public on a regular basis. In 1799 and 1800, Peale introduced lectures into the museum's program.</p>

            <head>Early American History Not</head>
            <p>This small collection contains a series of lectures that Peale delivered on a range of very important issues of the day. They include lectures on marriage, on natural history (four lectures), on the museum’s educational purpose, on domestic happiness, and on health. All of these lectures hope to outline ways to improve society. There is also a fascinating lecture titled “a voice in behalf of the oppressed.” Interestingly, part of this lecture defends Quaker pacifism, which runs counter to much of Peale’s actions in the Revolutionary War in which he arrested pacifists. This change of heart also comes through in his Autobiography when he apologizes for targeting Quakers during the war.</p>
