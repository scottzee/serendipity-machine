            <p>Theophilus Grew was a mathematician and almanac publisher. He conducted a private school in Philadelphia for the study of mathematics (1742-1750) and was appointed the first professor of mathematics at the College and Academy of Philadelphia in 1750.</p>

            <head>Early American History Note</head>
            <p>Theophilus Grew was an astronomer, teacher, and author in Philadelphia. He provided astronomical calculations for many almanacs, including Poor Richard’s. This single volume contains Grew’s astronomical calculations for 1746-1761 for Philadelphia, which likely served as the basis for data used in almanacs. He was also a teacher. He ran a school before joining the early faculty in what would become the University of Pennsylvania. The volume can shed light on astronomical methods and calculations in early America, and what type of methods may have been taught to students in 1750s Philadelphia.</p>
