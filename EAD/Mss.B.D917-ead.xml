            <abstract id="ref2" label="Abstract">L.C. Dunn was one of the most significant figures in the emerging field of developmental genetics in the 20th century. His T-locus work with the mouse established a number of important genetic principles, including ideas of gene interaction, the distribution of alleles in wild populations, and the factors that influence fertility. He wrote an important textbook of genetics, 
                <emph render="italic">Principles of Genetics </emph>(1925), in collaboration with Sinnott (and later Dobzhansky); other significant books authored or co-authored by him include 
                <emph render="italic">Heredity, Race and Society </emph>(1946), and 
                <emph render="italic">A Short History of Genetics </emph>(1965). He worked in poultry genetics for eight years at the Agricultural Experiment Station in Storrs, CT, from 1920-1928. The remainder of his career was spent at Columbia University, where he worked with rats, mice, and fruit flies, and proved himself to be an inspiring teacher as well. His interest in international scientific collaboration led him to establish ties to Soviet scientists, and to help relocate refugee scientists during World War II. He remained active in his profession to the end of his life. This collection includes correspondence, reports, notebooks, lectures, and photographs. It is a rich collection, documenting the development of American genetics as well as Dunn's interests in humanitarian efforts and international affairs. There is significant material relating to American-U.S.S.R. contacts, particularly in the files on the American-Soviet Friendship Council and the American-Soviet Science Society. There is much, as well, on the impact of the Lysenko controversy in the U. S. Dunn's inerestt in European scientists can also be seen in the sizable amount of material on the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars. Material relating to the Kilgore and Magnusson bills for the support of science (predecessors to the NSF) are also in the collection. Of note are data on the following: National Research Council Committee on Experimental Animals and Plants; research on the population study of the Jewish community in Rome; and Columbia University. There is much in the correspondence concerning Drosophila, poultry genetics, and other such topics; Walter Landauer is Dunn's major correspondent.</abstract>

            <p>The Dunn Papers are a major resource for the study of the history of genetics during the critical quarter century between 1930 and 1955. From his perch at Columbia, Dunn was well situated to take part in the sweeping changes in the field, and was deeply involved in the debates over the social implications of genetic thought. The collection includes a full suite of correspondence, reports, notebooks, lectures, and photographs documenting the development of American genetics as well as Dunn's interests in humanitarian efforts and international affairs.</p>
            <p>The Dunn Papers are rich in material relating to American-Soviet scientific contacts, particularly in the files on the American-Soviet Friendship Council and the American-Soviet Science Society. There is much, as well, on the impact of the Lysenko controversy in the United States, and Dunn's interest in European scientists can also be seen in the sizable quantity of material on the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars. Material relating to the Kilgore and Magnusson bills for the support of science (predecessors to the National Science Foundation) are also in the collection.</p>
            <p>Of note are data on the following: National Research Council Committee on Experimental Animals and Plants; research on the population study of the Jewish community in Rome; and files of material concerning Columbia University, where he spent most of his academic career. There is much in the correspondence concerning 
                <emph render="italic">Drosophila</emph>, poultry genetics, and other such topics. Volumetrically and, to a degree, scientifically, Dunn's major correspondent was Walter Landauer (ca. 1.5 linear feet); other correspondents include A. F. Blakeslee, Franz Boas, Kristine Bonnevie, Calvin B. Bridges, Alexis Carrel, Ernst Caspari, William E. Castle, Alfred E. Cohn, George W. Corner, Gunnar Dahlberg, Charles H. Danforth, Paul R.

            <p>L.C. Dunn was a seminal figure in the 20th century emergence of developmental genetics. His T-locus work with the mouse established a number of important genetic principles, including ideas of gene interaction, the distribution of alleles in wild populations, and the factors that influence fertility, and his influence spread, in part, through his widely used genetics textbook, 
                <title render="italic">Principles of Genetics</title> (N.Y.: McGraw Hill, 1925), written in collaboration with Edmund Ware Sinnott (and later Theodosius Dobzhansky). Other significant works authored or co-authored by Dunn include 
                <title render="italic">Heredity, Race and Society</title> (1946), and 
                <title render="italic">A Short History of Genetics</title> (1965).</p>
            <p>Leslie Clarence Dunn was born in Buffalo, New York in 1893, the son of Clarence Leslie and Mary Eliza (Booth) Dunn. At Dartmouth College from 1911-1915, he applied himself to the study of zoology under John H. Gerould, with whom he maintained life-long ties. It was through Gerould that he obtained a copy of T.H. Morgan's 
                <title render="italic">Heredity and Sex</title> in 1914, a book that significantly influenced the course of Dunn's professional career. Smitten with genetics, after graduating from Dartmouth, Dunn applied to study under Morgan at Columbia University, but was turned away from the already overcrowded fly lab. Instead, he took an assistantship to work with William E. Castle at Harvard, where he was assigned charge of the laboratory for breeding 
                <emph render="italic">Drosophila</emph>. His first significant work was a study of sex-linked genes in 
                <emph render="italic">Drosophila</emph>, but when his results were "scooped" by a student of Morgan, he turned to work on linked genes in mice and rats. He published eight papers on rodent genetics between 1916 and 1921, including his dissertation 
                <title render="italic">Linkage in Mice and Rats</title> (1920).</p>
            <p>Dunn's graduate work was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which he was commissioned as a First Lieutenant in the American Expeditionary Force in France. He married Louise Porter, a Smith College graduate, in 1918, with whom he had two sons, Robert Leslie (b.1921) and Stephen Porter (b.1928).</p>
            <p>After his release from the Army, Dunn's first professional position was serving as poultry geneticist at the Agricultural Experiment Station in Storrs, Connecticut. His time there (1920-1928) was productive, resulting in over forty papers on poultry genetics as well as the first edition of 
                <title render="italic">Principles of Genetics</title>. One of the most widely used genetics textbooks of its time, it went into five editions and was translated into numerous foreign languages.</p>
            <p>In 1929, Dunn was tapped by Columbia to fill the post vacated by Morgan, who had departed for the California Institute of Technology. As a full professor in the Zoology Department, Dunn quickly demonstrated his abilities as a teacher as well as a researcher, mentoring Simone Gluecksohn-Waelsch and Dorothea Bennett, among many others.</p>
            <p>Because life in the heart of New York City precluded large-scale research projects on poultry, Dunn revived his research on rodents and fruit flies, although he continued to keep hand in poultry, working in concert with Walter Landauer at Storrs. Initially, Dunn's mouse work at Columbia focussed on the problem of the inheritance of pigmentation, but his interest in congenital abnormalities soon led him to branch out into a study of lethal and semi-lethal mutants in research animals and compare them to similar conditions in humans. His work on T-locus mutants occupied over forty years and established him as a leader in developmental genetics. His research also verged on population genetics: he studied colonies of mice in both the laboratory and the field, establishing the principle that gametic selection could be even more powerful than natural selection.</p>
            <p>Possessed of a strong social conscience honed by association with his fellow Columbians Theodosius Dobzhansky and Franz Boas, Dunn took an active interest in human genetics and its social implications. During the 1920s and 1930s, he spoke out against the misapplication of genetics to justify mistreatment of oppressed groups of people, including blacks and Jews. He established an Institute for the Study of Human Variation at Columbia in the 1950s. Although the Institute was short-lived, several key research projects resulted from it, including Dunn's "The Jewish Community in Rome." The Institute also spawned a number of students who have made important contributions to human genetics, including R. H. Osborne and W. S. Pollitzer.</p>
            <p>In 1946, Dunn and Theodosius Dobzhansky collaborated on 
                <title render="italic">Heredity, Race, and Society</title>, an immensely important book that cast a genetist's eye on the race problem in America. Taking cues from the work of Ashley Montagu, Franz Boas, and others, the work was an important study of racial variation, but also a major statement on the vexing question coopted by eugenicists of the relationship between nature and nurture. "We come into the world," they wrote, "as a bundle of possibilities bequeathed to us by our parents and other ancestors. Our nurture comes from the world about us. What happens to the nurture that comes in depends, however, on the nature that receives it." Dunn and Dobzhansky concluded that nature and nurture were inseparably intertwined and integral to the shaping of human capacities, rendering the dichotomy between them not only misleading, but fundamentally wrong. In 1951 Dunn was selected to write the UNESCO report 
                <title render="italic">Race and Biology</title>, which carried this point further.</p>
            <p>Dunn's personal friendships with scientists and their families from around the world often served as a springboard into other activities. During a tour of Europe in 1927, for example, Dunn visited Russia as the guest of A.S. Serebrovsky. As a result of the experience, Dunn became a founder and active member of the American-Soviet Friendship Council and, during World War II, was the president of the American-Soviet Science Society. Deeply disturbed by the rise of Nazism, Dunn became an active member of the Emergency Committee for German Scholars (later called the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Scholars) in 1933, helping refugee scholars to relocate in American. Not surprisingly, Dunn's interest in international collaboration brought him under severe criticism. The organizations in which he took part were deemed subversive in the reactionary environment of the late 1940s and 1950s, and Dunn himself was accused of being a Communist.</p>
            <p>Dunn's internationalism and interest in Russian science drew him into the Lysenko controversy of the 1950s. The "dictator" of Soviet biology during the Stalinist era and beyond, Lysenko espoused eccentric ideas about agriculture and genetics, and led a wholesale assault on modern genetics theories. The Russian language edition of Dunn's 
                <title render="italic">Principles of Genetics</title> had sold more copies in Russian in the 1930s than the English original, however Lysenko banned the book.</p>
            <p>Dunn pursued his interest in genetics to the end of his life. When he retired from Columbia in 1962, he was granted emeritus status and set up a "mouse lab" to continue work in collaboration with his former student, Dorothea Bennett. Toward the end of his life he developed an interest in the history of science, writing 
                <title render="italic">A Short History of Genetics</title> in 1965. The donation of his papers to the American Philosophical Society helped to establish the APS archives as a premier facility for the study of the history of genetics.</p>
            <p>Dunn was a member of the American Philosophical Society (1943), the National Academy of Sciences (1943), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Norwegian Academy of Sciences, and the Italian Academia Pataviana. He was a founder of the Genetics Society of America, its President in 1932, and managing editor of its journal, 
                <title render="italic">Genetics</title>, from 1935 to 1940. He was also a member of the American Society of Naturalists, its President in 1960, and editor of its journal 
                <title render="italic">The American Naturalist</title>, from 1951 to 1960. He was a member of the American Society of Human Genetics, and its President in 1961. He also was a visiting professor at the Genetics Institute of the University of Oslo, Norway in 1934-35, at the Instituto Superiore de Sanita, Rome, in 1953-54, and at University College, London in 1960-61.</p>

                    <p>The scientific and professional correspondence of L.C Dunn provides a remarkable overview of the developments in genetic theory and research from the days of Morgan's fly lab into the molecular revolution of the 1950s and 1960s. Possessed of a sharp historical consciousness, Dunn appears to have been unusually good about retaining correspondence with his colleagues, and the resultant collection</p>
                    <p>The Dunn Papers are further valuable as a point of entry into the debates over the social implications of genetic thought in an international context. An activist, Dunn was heavily involved in the American Committee for Displaced German Scholars during the 1930s, the America-Soviet Science Society, and the American-Soviet Friendship Council, among other organizations. His surviving essays and lectures (filed under Dunn) frequently address the social aspects of genetics, whether discussing eugenics, the "race problem," Lysenkoism ("Science Under Socialism," "Soviet Genetics") or broader issues of heredity and environment.</p>
                    <p>In 1972 (1972-622ms) and 1974 (1974-454ms) and previously, Walter Landauer donated an extensive body of his correspondence with Dunn, which has been integrated into the collection. This correspondence was restricted during Dunn's lifetime, but is now open to researchers.</p>

                    <p>Miscellaneous photographs, primarily personal, of Dunn, his family and colleagues. Along with a small number of personal photos of Dunn from his childhood through old age, there are two outstanding photo albums. The first of these was kept by Dunn during his days as a student at Dartmouth (1911-1915), and is a fine example of the undergraduate genre, replete with images of cavorting students, football games, the winter carnival, the campus and his friends. There are several images of Dunn dressed as a woman (presumably as a stunt) and other of Dunn's friends in blackface.</p>
