            <p>This collection of seven volumes contains the minutes of various treaties the colony of Pennsylvania conducted with Native peoples. Some of these reports go beyond the minutes of the treaties and contain details about the governor’s entourage and travel. The volume that contains minutes for Indian treaties from 1758-1760 contains George Croghan’s journal from a trip to western areas in 1759. The Treaty of Easton (970.5 M659) contains a sketch of the land Teedyschung requested, a drawing that often has not been reproduced in accounts of the treaty minutes.</p>
