            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">Elsie Clews Parsons (1875-1941) was trained as a sociologist at Columbia University, but made her greatest achievements in the fields of anthropology and folklore. Parsons' early works in the field of sociology dealt primarily with gender roles, conventions of society, and the effect of society's pressures on the individual. After a trip to the American Southwest with her husband in 1910, Parsons' interests turned to anthropology. She began making field trips to Arizona and New Mexico and, under the influence of her friend Franz Boas, Parsons recorded in meticulous detail data on social organization, religious practices, and folklore of the Southwest Indians. Concurrently, Parsons conducted research in folklore, concentrating on folk tales of Afro-Americans and Caribbean peoples. She was active in a number of professional associations and was the associate editor of the 
                <emph render="italic">Journal of American Folklore </emph>from 1918 until her death. 
                <lb/>The Parsons Papers were acquired as two separate accessions and remains organized in two distinct subcollections. Subcollection I (572 P35), acquired in 1949, contains approximately 12 linear feet of materials focused on Parsons' career in anthropology. Subcollection II, acquired in 1985, consists of 26.25 linear feet of materials divided into ten series, covering a larger scope of Parsons' life, including family and personal correspondence.</abstract>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The Parsons Papers (1880-1980; bulk dates 1880-1942) contain correspondence, lectures, manuscripts of published and unpublished works, research notes and notebooks, and photographs which document the life of the anthropologist, Elsie Clews Parsons. While the bulk of the collection is comprised of material generated by Parsons during the course of her career, it includes some significant material collected by her, including Frank Hamilton Cushing's notebook of Zuni vocabulary, 1880, and valuable material collected about her.</p>
            <p>Many letters, especially in Subcollection II - Series II (Personal Correspondence) are undated. In cases where the bulk of the correspondence has no dates, "original" order (i.e. the order in which it arrived at this repository) was maintained. In folders where only a few undated letters exist, these items are placed following the dated ones. Dates in brackets with question marks are, for the most part, Peter H. Hare's estimation. Other dates supplied are by the repository's archivists and are taken from the postmark on the accompanying envelope. Envelopes were disposed of, but in cases where they are kept, for dating or exhibition purposes, the envelopes are placed 
                <emph render="bold">in front </emph>of the corresponding letter.</p>
            <p>The Elsie Clews Parsons Papers was acquired as two separate groupings and remains organized in that way. Subcollection I (12 linear feet acquired in 1949), is tightly focused on Parsons' professional career, and includes correspondence, ca. 1921-1941 (ca. 1000 items), notebooks, papers, photographs, news clippings, etc., relating to the tales, proverbs, and folklore of the West Indies; Jamaican Negro proverbs and sayings collected by George R. Drinkwater in 1892; "Filipino Village Reminiscences" by Parsons; riddles, folk tales, poems from York Village, Maine; materials on birth control; "Indian trait survey" by Edward W. Gifford; the Hopi notebooks of Alexander M. Stephens; ethnography and folklore of Pueblo of the southwest U.S., Mitla in Oaxaca, Mexico, and Peguch, Ecuador; and unpublished manuscripts on sleep, a trip to Greece, and "The World Changes." The correspondence pertains primarily to her publications and those written by others, and with her efforts for the American Anthropological Association, and the American Folklore Society. Correspondents include: Ruth Benedict, Franz Boas, Fay-Cooper Cole, Fred Eggan, Juan Gorrell, A. Irving Hallowell, Melville Herskovits, Alfred V. Kidder, Alfred L. Kroeber, Oliver La Farge, Robert H. Lowie, John E. Parsons, Robert Redfield, Gladys Reichard, Edward Sapir, Stith Thompson, and Leslie A. White.</p>
            <p>There is a great deal of material concerning Parson's publications in anthropology and folklore, with related correspondence and reviews of her work, along with numerous manuscripts relating to her commitment to feminist causes and pacifism during World War I. The collection includes at least four unpublished manuscripts: "In the Southwest" (a complete travel guide), "Imaginary Mistress," "Journal of a Feminist," and "Journal of a Pacifist." There is an interesting reminiscence of Parsons by Ralph Beals.</p>
            <p>The most recent materials in the Parsons Papers were assembled by Peter Hare who, with the family's consent, collected material on Parsons for his biography, 
                <emph render="italic">A Woman's Quest for Science </emph>(1985).</p>
            <p>In the following, notes have been added to clarify the relationships between Parsons and her correspondents. Such notes are usually intended to distinguish Elsie's husband Herbert from her son Herbert, and her father-in-law John E. Parsons, from her son John E. Parsons. Unless otherwise specified, the relationship given in the note (e.g. son) is that of the individual to Elsie Clews Parsons.</p>
            <p>Native American Image Note : Over 2,000 ethnographic images: 800 black and white silver gelatin photographs, 900 ink and pencil sketches, 100 color illustrations, 200 watercolor paintings of Pueblo Indians, particularly the Hopi, Isleta, Taos, Tewa, and Zuni. All images by Elsie Parsons, except where noted, the collection is organized in two separate groupings with a date range of 1880-1942. All social and cultural aspects are depicted such as men weaving, women making pottery, dwellings, masks, tools, prayer sticks, arrows and rattles. Series VIII in Ms. Coll. 29 presents extensive images of over twenty types of dances with some action and some group portraits of Native Americans in native attire. Numbers 60-66 in 572 P25.1 contain social customs of the Quechua of Ecuador and stencils of masks of the Kwakiutl of British Columbia. Of particular and rare note, Number 25 in 572 P25.1, contains 189 original watercolor and ink sketches by Joe Bartolo Lente, a Tewa from the Isleta pueblo of New Mexico. In 1962, 140 of the paintings were published by the Bureau of American Ethnology in Isleta Paintings. Other watercolors by Albert Looking Elk and other unidentified artists depict ceremonies such as the deer, snake and rain dance. The APS American Indian Collections Guide by John Freeman and manuscript sketch file contain descriptions and itemized lists of the images in the collection. Note: Pueblo tribes are particularly sensitive to depiction of their culture so respectful use of the images is requested.</p>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Elsie Worthington Clews Parsons (1875-1941) was a sociologist, anthropologist, and folklorist. By birth and marriage, Parsons belonged to the wealthy, social, and generally conservative circles of New York City. Nevertheless, the chose to study at newly founded Barnard College (B.A. 1896) and received a doctorate in sociology from Columbia University in 1899. In 1900 Elsie Clews married New York lawyer Herbert Parsons, who later became a Republican National Committeeman (1916-1920). They had six children, four of whom survived: Elsie ("Lissa") born in 1901, John Edward in 1903, Herbert in 1909, and Henry McIlvaine ("Mac") in 1911.</p>
            <p>Parsons' early works were in the field of sociology and dealt primarily with gender roles, conventions of society, and the effect of society's pressures on the individual. Her works on these subjects include: 
                <emph render="italic">The Family </emph>(1906), 
                <emph render="italic">The Old-Fashioned Woman </emph>(1913), 
                <emph render="italic">Fear and Conventionality </emph>(1914), 
                <emph render="italic">Social Freedom </emph>(1915), and 
                <emph render="italic">Social Rule </emph>(1916). She also wrote numerous newspaper and journal articles on feminism and pacifism.</p>
            <p>After a trip to the American Southwest with her husband in 1910, Parsons' interests turned to anthropology. She began making field trips to Arizona and New Mexico. Under the influence of her friend Franz Boas, Parsons recorded in meticulous detail data on social organization, religious practices, and folklore of the Southwest Indians. Her publications from this period include: 
                <emph render="italic">The Social Organization of the Tewa of New Mexico </emph>(1929), 
                <emph render="italic">Hopi and Zuni Ceremonialism </emph>(1933), and 
                <emph render="italic">Pueblo Indian Religion </emph>(1939). Later in her career, Parsons became interested in the Spanish influence on Indian cultures. She conducted research in Mexico and in Ecuador for her final ethnographies, 
                <emph render="italic">Mitla: Town of the Souls </emph>(1936) and 
                <emph render="italic">Peguche </emph>(1945).</p>
            <p>Concurrently, Parsons conducted research in folklore, concentrating on folk tales of Afro-Americans and Caribbean peoples. She travelled to the Carolinas, Cape Verde Islands, and Caribbean islands to collect tales, and she frequently funded anthropology students to collect data. Publications in this area of interest include: 
                <emph render="italic">Folk-Lore from the Cape Verde Islands </emph>(1923), 
                <emph render="italic">Folk-Lore of the Sea Islands, S.C. </emph>(1924), and 
                <emph render="italic">Folk-Lore of the Antilles, French and English </emph>(3v., 1933-1943).</p>
            <p>Elsie Clews Parsons held the office of President of the American Folklore Society (1918-1920), the American Ethnological Association (1923-1925), and the American Anthropological Association (1940-1941). She was the associate editor of the 
                <emph render="italic">Journal of American Folklore </emph>from 1918 until her death. Parsons also gave much financial support to these groups and financed field trips by young scholars.</p>

            <head>African American History Note</head>
            <p>Of particular interest to scholars of African American history is Parson's research in folklore. Parson produced three major monographs on African Americans and Afro-Caribbeans: Folk-Lore from the Cape Verde Islands (1923), Folk-Lore of the Sea Islands, S.C. (1924), and Folk-Lore of the Antilles, French and English (3 volumes, 1933-1943).</p>
            <p>Materials which may be of interest in the collection include: correspondence (e.g. with Melville Herskovits, Anson Phelps Stokes, and Franz Boas); several manuscripts -- "Arabic elements in Negro Folk Tales," "Folklore from Georgia," 1934, "Negro Folklore" (5 folders), "Old signs in Alabama" and "Spirituals in Alabama," "Provenience of certain Negro folk-tales" (6 folders) in Series III; and research notes on African American folklore (Series IV).</p>

                    <p>Subcollection II is comprised of 26.25 linear feet of personal and professional correspondence, early childhood material, miscellaneous geneaological, autobiographical, and other manuscripts, financial records, and photographs. acquired in 1985. A rich assemblage, Parsons II differs from the previous Parsons accession in documenting a larger scope of Parsons' life, and in particular, it includes a wealth of family and personal material and a greater representation of her interests outside of anthropology and folklore.</p>
                    <p>Parsons II The more personal, family material includes correspondence between Parsons and her children, and more extensively (1898-1925) with her husband Herbert (1869-1925), many written while Parsons was conducting research in field. Many other anthropologists are represented in the correspondence, the most notable being the large number of letters (ca. 1915-1930s) from Alfred L. Kroeber, whose letters discuss personal matters, the state of anthropology at Berkeley and elsewhere, and colleagues and mutual friends.</p>
                    <p>The collection also includes an interesting family genealogy, "Record of Family Faculties" (a printed form-book devised by Francis Galton) which includes photographs of Parsons and others, with a detailed description of herself, and Parsons's financial records, which provide detailed documentation of Parsons's self-financed field research during the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
                    <p>The collection contains incoming and outgoing manuscript and typescript letters, postcards and telegrams generated during Parsons' career. Series I is arranged alphabetically by correspondent's name and then chronologically within each file. Chronologically, the correspondence is evenly distributed. Colleague's manuscript articles and short papers are included in this series under the author's name. Unidentified correspondence has been filed as "Unidentified" and is arranged chronologically.</p>
                    <p>Correspondence relates to Parsons' interests in sociology, anthropology, and professional and political organizations. In ambiguous cases of professional vs. personal relationships, the correspondence has been filed in this series. Correspondents include: Franz Boas, Randolph S. Bourne, Clarence Day, Jr., P.E. Goddard, Francis Hackett, A.L. Kroeber, C. Grant La Farge, Mabel Dodge Luhan, Gladys A. Reichard, and Morris Titiev.</p>

                        <p>contains Parsons' addresses, lectures, and manuscripts. Notes or drafts that can be identified have been placed in this series. Unidentifiable notes or drafts have been placed in Series IV as "Miscellaneous." Correspondence with publishers, critiques from colleagues, and printed reviews have been placed in this series by manuscript title. Arrangement is alphabetical by type of material (e.g. Address, Manuscript), and within each type alphabetical by title. There is a bibliographic card file kept by Parsons from 1914 to 1920, listing articles sent to publishers with notes made on rejections and acceptances. Some items are from Parsons' graduate coursework at Columbia University. Subjects include all of Parsons' interests: anthropology of the Southwest, sociology, feminism, pacifism, and folklore, in addition to a few fictional works. Unpublished manuscripts include: "In the Southwest," "The Imaginary Mistress," "Journal of a Feminist," and "Journal of a Pacifist."</p>

                        <p>contains primarily notes on Indians of the Southwest, especially the Hopi and the Zuni, and Mexico. The Mexican material includes two handwritten manuscripts of "La Conquista," which relates the historical events between Montezuma and Cortez. The undated "Conquista" manuscript contains elaborate pen-and-ink drawings. There is also a large section of notes on Arabic and Sudanese folklore, as well as that of Nova Scotia, the Cape Verde Islands, and several other island communities. In addition, there is a smaller section of notes on the folklore of African-American communities. This series also includes the stenographer's notebooks kept by Parsons' secretary, Anne Nagle, from the years 1929-1935?. All of Nagle's notebooks are taken in Gregg shorthand, and contain correspondence, notes and tales. Notebooks and notes are arranged alphabetically by subject, and then chronologically within each subject. Unidentified notes appear in this series under "Miscellaneous." The bulk dates for the notebooks are from 1915 to 1932.</p>

The bulk of Herbert Parsons' papers are deposited in the Columbia University Libraries.</p>

                        <p>contains newspaper clippings, concert programs, museum pamphlets, postcards, miscellaneous items, and a few artifacts from Parsons' possessions. There is a beautiful portfolio which originally contained a large portion of photographs and ephemera. Of interest in this series are the clippings on the Bursum Bill regarding Indian rights. The poems to Elsie and Herbert Parsons, and "Marriage Customs and Taboos Among the Early Heterodites" are amusing. Other ephemera may be found in Ser. VIII, [Scrapbook] which includes photographs as well as commencement programs, correspondence, and passenger lists from various trips.</p>

                        <p>holds prints, negatives, plates, and albums of family, friends, and homes. Of note are the negatives of Elsie and Herbert's 1905 trip with William Howard Taft to the Philippines, and two mini-albums by Gladys A. Reichard with photographs of Parsons, Boas, and Margaret Mead among others. With the exception of Mexico, there are very few photographs of Parsons' field trips and subjects of study. There is a large series of photographs, and negatives, of John and Lissa Parsons from 1908. There are also a small group of photographs of Elsie Clews as a young girl. Of particular note in this series is the "Record of Family Faculties" which includes photographs of and biographical information on the Parsons and Clews families. The series is arranged alphabetically by subject, and then chronologically. Unidentified subjects were filed under "Unidentified."</p>
