            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">Dell Hymes' doctoral research on Kathlamet Chinook (Indiana University, 1955) grew into a lifelong interest in the relationship between ethnography and linguistics. Following academic appointments at Harvard University (1955-1960) and the University of California, Berkley (1960-1965), Hymes joined the Department of Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania in 1965. During twenty-two years tenure at Penn he was a professor of folklore, linguistics, sociology and education. In 1975, he was promoted to Dean of the Graduate School of Education (1975-1987). A principal proponent of the emergent field of sociolinguistics, his most influential works include 
                <emph render="italic">Reinventing Anthropology</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Language in Culture and Society.</emph>
                <lb/>The Hymes papers cover all aspects of Dell Hymes' professional life, though concentrated on his years at the University of Pennsylvania, his presidencies of the American Association of Anthropology and the Linguistic Society of America, and his editorship of the journal 
                <emph render="italic">Language in Society.</emph> Of particular interest is his rich correspondence with colleagues and students on linguistic issues. The papers reflect Hymes' interests in the history of linguistics and anthropology, Native American languages, and his comparative ethnographies of communication.</abstract>

            <p>The Hymes' papers reflect linguistic anthropology's shift to sociolinguistics during the 1960s to 1980s. While the papers contain Hymes' study of the Chinookan language, their primary focus is the concept of language as social phenomenon. Within the Series I and II, he urges the need for comparative studies that view speech as part of a broader cultural system of communicative action. The correspondence is diverse, including fellow anthropologists plus social scientists, poets, educators, communicators and literary scholars.</p>
            <p>The collection also mirrors Hymes' interests in the problems of language reconstruction and the history of linguistics and of anthropology. The largest series, Series V, contains accepted and rejected works for the journal 
                <emph render="italic">Language in Society</emph>. The papers are a rich resource in social causes of the 1960s and 1970s, including the Vietnam peace movement, the ethical issues for anthropologists in Thailand, and the blacklisting of scientists for their political actions.</p>
            <p>Throughout the collection, Hymes' social conscience is ever present. It resounds with the changes he championed within his discipline and within the academic community.</p>
            <p>The papers (140 boxes; 70 linear feet) are divided into five series:</p>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Dell Hathaway Hymes, an anthropologist, linguist, and educator, is best known for his studies of the language and culture of Native Americans at the Warm Springs reservation in Central Oregon. He was born in Portland, Oregon on 7 June 1927, the son of Howard Hathaway and Dorothy (Bowman) Hymes. After two years of military service (1945-1947), Hymes received his undergraduate degree from Reed College (1950) and went on to study linguistic anthropology under Carl Voegelin at Indiana University. Thus was the beginning of his lifelong linguistic study of the Wasco tribe. His dissertation, 
                <emph render="italic">The Language of Kathlamet Chinook </emph> (1955), was drawn from texts recorded and published by Franz Boas. After his marriage to Virginia Margaret Dosch in 1954, Hymes continued his post-graduate work with Harry Hoijer at UCLA. Between 1955-1960, he taught social anthropology at Harvard University and then went on to teach anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley (1960-1965).</p>
            <p>Hymes' long association with the University of Pennsylvania began in 1965 as a professor of anthropology. Over his twenty-two year tenure at Penn he was a professor of folklore, linguistics, sociology, and education with a promotion to Dean of the Graduate School of Education (1975-1987). He also served on various committees at Penn including the Committee on problems of War and Peace, the Christian Association, the Committee on Language, Culture and Society, and the Haney Foundation Editorial Committee.</p>
            <p>Hymes' first published work was in historical linguistics, 
                <emph render="italic">Language in Culture and Society </emph> (1964). He believed that those who studied both linguistics and anthropology need to develop an opinion on the relation of language to culture. All of Hymes' works has been a response to finding a relationship between the two. He argues that linguistics should be based on a conception of language as social phenomena. As a result of this perspective, Hymes became a principal proponent of the emergent field of sociolinguistics. His other edited works include 
                <emph render="italic">The Use of Computers in Anthropology </emph> (1965), 
                <emph render="italic">Studies in Southwestern Ethnolinguistics </emph> (1967), 
                <emph render="italic">Pidginization and Creolization of Languages </emph> (1971), 
                <emph render="italic">Reinventing Anthropology</emph> (1972). Some later published works include 
                <emph render="italic">Foundations of Sociolinguistics </emph> (1974), 
                <emph render="italic">Language in Education: ethnolinguistic essays</emph> (1980), 
                <emph render="italic">In Vain I Tried to Tell You: essays in Native American ethnopoetics </emph> (1981), 
                <emph render="italic">American Structuralism </emph> (with John Fought, 1981). He returned to his historical perspective with the work 
                <emph render="italic">Essays in the History of Linguistic Anthropology </emph>in 1983. With John Gumperz, he edited 
                <emph render="italic">Directions in Sociolinguistics: the enthnography of communication </emph> (1986) that views speech as a part of a broader cultural system of communication action.</p>
            <p>Hymes was also very active in professional organizations. With his strong interest in combating elitism and to ensure that anthropologists maintain knowledge of other societal disciplines, he has served on many executive boards. He has had a career-long association with the Social Science Research Council as one of the founding members of the Committee on Sociolinguistics (1963-1980). He served as president of the American Folklore Society (1973-1974), the Linguistic Society of America (1982), the American Anthropological Association (1983), and the American Association of Applied Linguistics (1986).</p>
            <p>In 1972, Hymes founded the journal 
                <emph render="italic">Language in Society</emph> and served as its primary editor until 1992. Other associate editor services include work with 
                <emph render="italic">The Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences </emph> (1966-1993), 
                <emph render="italic">American Journal of Sociology </emph> (1977-1980), 
                <emph render="italic">Journal of Pragmatics </emph> (1977-), and 
                <emph render="italic">Theory and Society </emph> (1976-1996). In 1987, Hymes accepted the position of professor of Anthropology and English at the University of Virginia and became emeritus in 2000. He continues to work on Native American languages focusing on the analysis of oral narratives in verse. Dr. Hymes and his wife, Virginia, presently reside in Charlottesville, Virginia. They are the parents of Robert Paul (adopted), Alison Bowman, Kenneth Dell and Vicki (stepchild).</p>

                    <p>Ingoing and outgoing manuscript and typescript letters, carbons, telegrams and postcards generated during Hymes' career, some personal, but primarily professional. This series often contains scholarly works by the correspondent, or by Hymes, or occasional works of others for reference. If a body of work is critiqued by Hymes in a correspondence, then it is contained within the file. For easier access, letters, previously filed by subject, are now filed by correspondent.</p>
                    <p>Since Hymes edited many works, many files contain cover copies to the principals involved in the work. Some files are topical, such as Margaret Mead, which includes correspondence with her but also newspaper clippings and related material.</p>
                    <p>The letters of invitation, sampled at every fifth letter, show acceptances in Hymes early career (1950s, 1960s) with more declinations in his days as Dean (1977-1987). The reprints, also sampled at every fifth letter, are divided into requests by others (for Hymes' work) and request by Hymes (of others' works), which includes unsolicited gifts of books and articles. Of particular note, the consultation correspondence is advice given by Hymes to students and colleagues in various areas of linguistic studies.</p>
                    <p>Note: Hymes' responses are often carbon-copied onto the back of the original letter or onto scrap paper. Arranged alphabetically by correspondent name, then chronological.</p>
