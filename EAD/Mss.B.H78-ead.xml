            <p>David Hosack (1769-1835, APS 1810) was a physician and botanist active in medical education, as well as cultural life of New York City. Hosack founded Elgin Botanic Gardens, the first botanical gardens in America, co-founded the New York Historical Society and the short-lived Rutgers Medical School in New York City.</p>
            <p>David Hosack was born in New York City. He started his education at Columbia College, but received his degree from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1789. Hosack studied medicine under Nicholas Romayne, Philip Wright Post and Samuel Bard in New York; he then traveled to Philadelphia to study with Benjamin Rush. In 1791 he traveled to Scotland to continue studying medicine and botany.</p>
            <p>Upon his return to America in 1795, Hosack became professor of botany at Columbia College a post he held in conjunction with the professorship of material medica until 1811. In 1797 Hosack went into practice with his former mentor Samuel Bard. Hosack was well respected by his patients, who often remarked that he went further than most other physicians to care to their comfort. In 1804 Hosack was the attending surgeon for the Burr-Hamilton duel. He attended Hamilton to the dueling place and cared for him for the subsequent 30 hours after he received his mortal wound.</p>
            <p>Beyond his practice, Hosack was active in the medical profession. Together with his student, John W. Francis, Hosack established 
                <emph render="italic">American Medical and Philosophical Register </emph>, which was published from 1810-1814. In 1826, Hosack founded the Rutgers Medical School of New York City, serving as president until 1830. And in 1820 Hosack was largely the driving force behind the founding of Bellvue Hospital.</p>
            <p>Hosackâ€™s interests outside of the medical profession were numerous. He established the Elgin Botanic Gardens, the first such gardens in America. He was a founder of the New York Historical Society, serving as president from 1820-1828. Hosack was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1810. Hosack married three times, and was widowed twice; he had 10 children. He died suddenly of apoplexy in 1835</p>
