            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The period covered by this collection constitutes almost the entire period of Harvey's career at Princeton University where he began in 1911 as an instructor of Physiology under E. G. Conklin and went on to become Henry Fairfield Osborne Professor of Biology in 1933 to Processor Emeritus 1956 -59. Before beginning his career at Princeton, Harvey obtained his undergraduate degree in General Science at the University of Pennsylvania in 1909, where he studied under Conklin, H.S. Jennings and John MacFarlane. His graduate studies were pursued at Columbia University under the zoologist Thomas Hunt Morgan, his thesis was entitled "The Permeability of Cells," and he was awareded a Ph.D. in 1911.</p>
            <p>In addition to his teaching and research at Princeton, Harvey held a long association with the Wood's Hole Marine Biological Station, making it a practice to conduct and direct research there at some time during every summer. He became a Trustee of the Station in 1929 and later Vice-President in 1942. Nearly all the material in the collection concerning Wood's Hole is contained in Box 9 - #12 files, which has materials relating to Executive Committee Meetings, 1946-47, Budgets, 1945-48, Report of the Additional Funds Committee 1942 (set up to try and procure funds for the Station so that it be transformed into a year round research center and not be restricted to summer research only), there are other letters in file 5 of this box, concerning correspondence between the Trustees and the Rockefeller Foundation about this matter, and Reports of the Felowship Committee 1946.</p>
            <p>Besides these details of the Marine Biological Station there is little in the collection pertaining to Harvey's voluminous commitments and dutiies outside his Princeton position. For example, he wa a member of many professional associations among them being the National Academy of Sciences (elected 1934), the American Philosophical Society (1929), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (elected 1910, Fellow, 1921), member of the American Physiological Society (1914) and the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine (1919) to name but a few. He became managing Editor of the Journal of Cellular and Comparative Physiology, 1932-39, Editor of the Journal of Experimental Biology, 1930-34, Editor of the Biological Buletin 1930-53, and Section Editor of Biological Abstracts 1930-53 of which there is some mention in Box e (Biological Abstracts, 1948-49), where Harvey wanted papers pertaining to bioluminescence to be in his section of general physiology.</p>
            <p>Much of this collection concerns Harvey's work in Bioluminescence at Princeton, especially correspondence with scientistis and naturalists throughout the world to make arrangements for the collection of luminous plants and animals and their classification. See - (Barber, H.S., Box 2 - U.S.D.A. Bureau of Entomology, 7 letters 1915-26), (Bowden, Bernald J. Box 2, 10 letters, 1949-50), Chapin, Edward A., Box 2, 1951 of the Smithsonian Institution), (Hastings J. Woodland, Box 3, 1952-56, c. 20 letters), and (Parker, Harry L., Box 4, 1943-46).</p>
            <p>It must be said that the bulk of the colelction pertains to the period 1942-46 and Harvey's work at Princeton under the auspices of the various Committees and Subcommittees of teh National Research Council, set up in War-time acting for the Committee of Medical Research of the Office of Scientific Research &amp; Development. Harvey worked as a member of the Subcommittee of Wound Ballistics, 1944-46, Decompression Sickness, 1943-46 and the Subcommittee on Missile Casualties, 1943-46. See Box 5: -Bulletin on Missile Casualties - circulated in installments for members of the Subcommittee with lists of members attending each meeting, #5 files. Bulletins Chariman of the Division of Medical Sciences of teh NRC, discharging these Subcommittees in 1946 after the War had ended. Committee on Aviation Medicine Reports 1940-45 and Committee on Medical Research Reports Nos. 1-79 #5 files, 1944-46. Also Box 6, Committees on Military Medicine of the Division of Medical Sciences of the NRC, with a list of all the names and addresses of these Committees and Subcommittees with an index of names of committee members, 1944. Box 7, Decompression Sickness Mimiographed Reports Nos. 1-20 &amp; 127-469, 1942-45, monthly progress reports, and Final Decompression Sickness Report, #7 files of which Harvey was responsible for the section 'Bubble Formation in Animals." Missile Casualties Reports #11 files 1944-46, and Box 14 which consists totally of Wound Ballistics Reports #24 files 1945 &amp; 1946. For anyone wishing to carry out research into the activities of scientists during the War period this collection would be an excellent source of information. Harvey was also funded at other times by teh Defense Authorities, (See Box 8, Progress Reports, #4 files, 1949-50, Reports to the Office of teh Quartermaster of the Dept. of the Army, on the investigation of using luminous materials for the invention of a nightwriting device).</p>
            <p>Throughout the collection, there is much reference to Havey's published works, with many drafts of articles see (Box 7, Evolution of Bioluminescence and its Relation to Cell Respiration), (Box 8 Luminescence of Animals), and (Box 8 A General Survey of Bioluminescence, 1946). Tehre are many rough notes and translations from early works mostly done by a Mrs. Hajo Holborn (Box 5, Casato P. de Inge) and (Box 12 Quotations from Authors re: Fire Files, #3 files), and (Box 2, Academic Press concerning Havey's book "Bioluminescence," published 1952)</p>
            <p>Reference to some of Harvey's graduate students are dispersed throughout the files, some in reference to grant proposals of which some are included in the collection. (See Peter S. Marfey, Box 3, 1955-58, c. 30 letters), (Box 3, Howard Mason, 1950-53) (Box 7, "Fish Bioluminescence," grant proposal to NSF 1958-59 including the names of F.H. Johnson and Yata Haneda as research associates). (Box 12, Reports - #6 files, Annual Report to NSF 1957 for project "Biochemistry of Light Production in the Ostracod Crustacean, Cypridina; plus the Grant Proposal 1952), (also Box 12, Report for Research Corporation which funded the project 'Chemical Nature of Cypridina Luceferin, 1952) and (Box 12 Reports of work carried out under grant from the Office of Naval Research, 1952-54 "Chemistry of Light Production in Living Organisms.").</p>
            <p>In this collection there are no correspondents whom one could label major, since much of the correspondence between Harvey and others consists of only a few letters, and are mostly concerning the collection of specimens, the remainder of the collection consists of Government reports.</p>
            <p>The collection is arranged alphabetically in files and each file being arranged chronologically the way it arrived from Princeton. The unpublished guide follows this pattern and is an alphabetical list of contents.</p>
