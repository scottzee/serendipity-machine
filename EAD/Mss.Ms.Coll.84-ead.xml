            <p>An anthropologist and Iroquoian scholar, Elisabeth Jane Tooker was born on August 2, 1927 in Brooklyn, New York. Following an undergraduate career at Radcliffe College, from which she graduated in 1949, Tooker pursued graduate study in anthropology at the University of Arizona (MA, 1953), and Radcliffe, working on Indians of the American Southwest.</p>
            <p>Before completing her degree at Radcliffe, Tooker was employed as a Teaching Fellow at Harvard from 1956-1957, and in 1957, she accepted a position as Instructor at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Tooker remained at SUNY Buffalo for two years after completion of her dissertation, "Ritual, Power and the Supernatural: A Comparative Study of Indian Religions in Southwestern United States," in March, 1958, before joining the faculty at Mount Holyoke College as Assistant Professor. A grant from the National Institute of General Medical Science (part of the National Institutes of Health) in 1964 enabled her to spend an intensive year in Cambridge, Mass., studying North American Indian curing practices and theories of disease.</p>
            <p>Shortly after returning from her leave in 1965, Tooker accepted a position at Temple University, where she remained for the rest of her career, earning promotion to Associate Professor in 1967 and Professor in 1977. During her stay at Temple, she continued her research through a Temple Summer Faculty Research Award and Research Grant-in-Aid in 1966, a Study Leave for the academic year 1971-1972, a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities (1981-1982), and a Smithsonian Institution Post-Doctoral Fellowship (1989-1990). She was also a Visting Professor at the State University of New York at Albany 1978-1979.</p>
            <p>From the time of her move to Philadelphia, Tooker began increasingly to concentrate her research on the history and culture of Indians in the Northeast, and particularly the Iroquois. Among her several books are 
                <title render="italic">An ethnography of the Huron Indians, 1615-1649 </title>(1964); 
                <title render="italic">The Indians of the Northeast: a critical bibliography </title>(1978), and 
                <title render="italic">Lewis H. Morgan on Iroquois Material Culture </title>(1994), along with several edited volumes, including four volumes of the proceedings of the American Ethnological Society (1978-1981), one volume from the Conference on Iroquois Research (1965), and three volumes of 
                <title render="italic">An Iroquois Sourcebook. </title>Tooker was also a contributing author and a member of the planning committee of the Northeast volume of the 
                <title render="italic">Handbook of North American</title>
                <title render="italic">Indians </title>that was published in 1978.</p>
            <p>Tooker has been a member of many professional anthropological organizations, including the American Ethnological Society (editor of 
                <title render="italic">American Ethnologist</title>, 1978-1982); the American Society for Ethnohistory (Executive Committee, 1973-1975; President, 1981-1982); the Conference on Iroquois Research (Planning Committee; Program Chair); the Northeastern Anthropological Association (Secretary, 1966-1968); and the Philadelphia Anthropological Society (Vice-President, 1967; President, 1969; Treasurer, 1988-1992). Her success in the profession has earned recognition as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1960), as an alumna member of Phi Beta Kappa (through Radcliffe College, 1974), and as recipient of the Cornplanter Medal for Iroquois Research (1986).</p>
            <p>In other professional activities, Tooker has served as a consultant to the exhibit, "American Indian Life, 1776-1976," at the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania (for which she co-authored an exhibit catalog); a member of the Visiting Committee of the Board of Overseers of Harvard University to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology (1977-1981); a member of the Phillips Fund grant committee of the American Philosophical Society (1979); a member of the National Advisory Committee of the Conference on Native American Studies at Oklahoma State University (1982-1985); and a Consulting Scholar for the University of Pennsylvania's University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (1982-present). Tooker became Professor Emerita at Temple University in 1992, and she currently resides in Philadelphia.</p>

                    <p>Mostly unpublished works, including many papers written for graduate courses at the University of Arizona and at Radcliffe College. Most of the works are on Iroquois topics, but there are also graduate papers about Southwestern Indians, including the Navaho, Yumans, and Papago Indians. There are a number of works about the nineteenth century anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan, and there is one work on the Handsome Lake religion ("History of the Handsome Lake Church"). There are two drafts of Tooker's published article, "The United States Constitution and the Iroquois League." The earliest item in this series is Tooker's undergraduate honors thesis, "An Interpretation of the Navaho Death Complex with Comparisons to the Apache and Pueblo," written in April 1949 at Radcliffe College. This series also contains Tooker's master's thesis, "Papagos in Tucson: An Introduction to Their History, Community Life, and Acculturation," written at the University of Arizona in 1952, and her doctoral thesis, "Ritual, Power and the Supernatural: A Comparative Study of Indian Religions in Southwestern United States," written for Radcliffe College in March 1958.</p>

There are field notes about the Southwestern Yaqui Indians (in Pascua, Arizona), the Southwestern Papago Indians, and the Iroquois Tonawanda Reservation. There are also some notes taken at the American Anthropological Association meeting in 1982. This series contains one card file that is mainly about the Papago Indians; there are a few cards about the Yaqui Indians in the town of Pascua.</p>

                    <p>Photographs from Tooker's 1952 master's thesis, "Papagos in Tucson: An Introduction to Their History, Community Life, and Acculturation"; photographs (sent to Tooker by Janet S. Pollak) of chipped stone turtles; and a photograph (originally in the Papago card file in Series V) of a group of Papago Indians. There are also photographs of dioramas that are in the Museum of Arts and Sciences in Rochester, New York and in the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society. These photographs were collected for possible use in the proposed tourist attraction, Iroquoia. (This note applies to images listed in the inventory)</p>
                    <p>Native American Images note : Over 2,000 images, dated 1940-2000, scattered throughout all the Series, of many Native American tribes, primarily the Six Nations of the Iroquois and the Tohono O’odham (Papago). Nearly 300 black and white gelatin photographs of Tohono O’odham (Papago) in Tucson, Arizona taken by Tooker for her masters and doctoral theses from 1952-1958, of social customs including ceremonial dances, races, processions, and dwellings. Some are photographic reprints of Native American life ca. 1900 and 1925. Other images reflect Tooker’s professional research of proposed and published works such as the Louis Henry Morgan collection, anthropology in Philadelphia, Iroquois dioramas, and studies of wampum. Of note, is a cabinet card of Ely S. Parker’s sister, Caroline Parker Mountpleasant, a Seneca Indian of the Wolf Clan. Images from other sources include color photographs of the Neville Museum exhibit of the Iroquois and the Constitution, photomechanical prints of pictographs of the migration of the Akwesasne, and color slides of North American Indian tomahawks from the British Museum. Of local interest, a black and white photomechanical print from the Indiana University Museum of “Indians and cowboys assembled before Wanamaker’s” department store in Philadelphia, PA, 1908. The Oversize collection contains maps of Native American reservations in New York State, the area between Albemarle Sound and Lake Erie, and the southern and eastern boundaries of Pennsylvania.</p>
