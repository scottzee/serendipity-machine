            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">Alfred Irving ("Pete") Hallowell was an anthropologist best known for his studies of Ojibwa culture and world-view, and the innovative use of the Rorschach Test in his studies of the psychological interrelations of individuals and their culture. Early in his career, Hallowell worked as a social case worker for Family Service, and even after moving on to study anthropology in 1920 (M.A.), he carried with him an interest in ethnic and racial culture, developing additional interests in psychological testing. Except for the years 1944-1947, when he taught at Northwestern University, Hallowell spent his entire career at the University of Pennsylvania where he was professor of anthropology, professor of anthropological psychiatry in the Medical School, and curator of social anthropology at the University Museum. A cultural anthropologist, Hallowell's use of clinical psychological methods, especially Rorschach tests, was both innovative and controversial in his discipline. In his research, he concentrated on the Algonkian Indians, especially the Abenaki and Ojibwa Indians of Canada and Wisconsin (Berens River, Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin areas), and the Saulteaux of Berens River. 
                <lb/>The Alfred Irving Hallowell Papers (1892-1981) contain correspondence, subject files, manuscripts of published and unpublished works by Hallowell, papers by colleagues and students, research notes kept by Hallowell, with a special emphasis on social organization, personality, behavior, psychology, religion, and folklore. The collection of several hundred photographs provides rich graphic documentation of Hallowell's work among the Ojibwa and Abnaki Indians during the 1930s.</abstract>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Alfred Irving ("Pete") Hallowell was an anthropologist best known for his studies of Ojibwa culture and their world-view, and the innovative use of the Rorschach Test in his studies of the psychological interrelations of individuals and their culture. He was born on 28 December 1892 in Philadelphia, the son of Edgar Lloyd and Dorothy Edsall Hallowell. After a three-year course at a manual high school, Hallowell attended the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce of the University of Pennsylvania. Since at that time the Wharton School was home to the social sciences and had a flexible curriculum, Hallowell took several elective courses in sociology and economics. By the time he graduated in 1914, Hallowell had abandoned the idea of a business career in favor of one in the social sciences. Hallowell lacked the finances to continue with graduate studies immediately, so he became a caseworker with the Family Society and took courses in anthropology on the side. Lectures by Alexander A. Goldenweiser, an anthropologist at the Pennsylvania School of Social Work, introduced Hallowell to the use of psychoanalytic theory in social science. He also took several courses with anthropologist Frank G. Speck at the University of Pennsylvania, who inspired Hallowell's interest in working with Native American cultures.</p>
            <p>Speck helped Hallowell obtain a Harrison Fellowship so that he could pursue full-time graduate work in anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. Hallowell earned an master's degree in 1920, and his thesis research involved fish nets and netting in North America. In 1924 Hallowell received a PhD in anthropology. His dissertation, "Bear Ceremonialism in the Northern Hemisphere," was published as an entire issue of 
                <emph render="italic">American Anthropologist </emph>in 1926. This study reveals the complex system of beliefs and ceremonies about the bear that were practiced among primitive peoples living throughout the circumboreal culture area of northern Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
            <p>Hallowell's field studies, which began in the late 1920s, involved the Abenaki of Quebec; the Montagnais-Naskapi of Labrador; and especially the Ojibwa-speaking peoples of the Lake Winnipeg region. His studies provide a complete ethnographic record of Ojibwa culture, including aspects of kinship and social organization, economics, technology, ecological relationships, medicine, religion, and folklore. Hallowell went beyond ethnological issues to those involving the psychological dimensions of Ojibwa acculturation. Such pioneering research required the development of new methodology, and Hallowell chose to make use of the then-new Rorschach Tests. Hallowell saw the Rorschach Test as a subtle and relatively culture-free way of probing the complexities of personality. Additionally, the Rorschach Test allowed comparisons on both an individual and group basis. Hallowell published several works on both the methodological theory and field use of Rorschach Tests, including "Rorschach Protocols of 151 Berens River Adults and Children and 155 Adults From Lac du Flambeau," and "The Rorschach Technique in Personality and Culture Studies."</p>
            <p>In later years Hallowell's research involved the history of Native American-white relationships and the history of anthropology. Before Hallowell, little had been written on the impact of Native Americans on Euro-American culture. His ground-breaking studies in this area culminated in such publications as "The Backwash of the Frontier: The Impact of the Indian on American Culture." Hallowell's later studies also included the psychological dimension of human evolution, which brought together "as an integral whole the organic, psychological, social, and cultural dimensions of the evolutionary process as they relate to the underlying conditions necessary for human existence." (See Series III, "On Being an Anthropologist: Some Autobiographical Reflections," p. 13.) His publications in this area include "Personality Structure and the Evolution of Man," and "Hominid Evolution, Cultural Adaptation, and Mental Dysfunction.</p>
            <p>Except for three years (1944-1947) at Northwestern University, Hallowell spent his entire professional career at the University of Pennsylvania. Hallowell began there in 1922 as an instructor in anthropology, progressing to the the rank of professor in 1939 and chairman of the department in 1941. Between 1947 and 1971, Hallowell was professor of anthropology in psychiatry and curator of social anthropology at the University Museum. After his retirement, he remained active as a visiting professor at the University of Washington, the University of Wisconsin, Bryn Mawr College, the University of Chicago, Temple University, and Chatham College. Throughout his career, Hallowell was an active member of professional societies, serving as president of the American Anthropological Association and the American Folklore Society, chairman of the Division of Anthropology and Psychology of the National Research Council; and a board member of the American Council of Learned Societies and the International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences. He was editor of the American Ethnological Society Monograph series, as well as of publications of the Wenner-Gren Foundation.</p>
            <p>Hallowell's professional service and achievements have earned the deep respect of his colleagues and students. Two publications have been printed in his honor: 1) 
                <emph render="italic">Culture and Experience, </emph>in honor of his sixtieth birthday; and 2) 
                <emph render="italic">Context and Meaning in Cultural Anthropology</emph>, his festschrift edited by Melford E. Spiro. In 1976 Fogelson et al. published 
                <emph render="italic">Contributions to Anthropology: Selected Papers of A. Irving Hallowell, </emph>a collection of Hallowell's later works that serves as a complementary volume to 
                <emph render="italic">Culture and Experience</emph>. Hallowell's numerous awards include a Guggenheim fellowship (1940-1941) for studies of personality in primitive cultures; the Viking Medal (1956) for outstanding achievement in anthropology; and memberships in the National Academy of Sciences (1961) and the American Philosophical Society (1963).</p>
            <p>Hallowell died, after a long illness, in Wayne, Pennsylvania, on 10 October 1974. He was survived by his wife, Maude Frame Hallowell.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                    <p>Contains the incoming and outgoing manuscript and typescript letters, carbons, telegrams, and postcards generated by Hallowell and his colleagues, Native American field informants, students, and family. Professional correspondence includes a letter from Elsie Clews Parsons regarding the American Folklore Society and a letter from Franz Boas in reference to Kwakiutl bear ceremonialism. Native American correspondents include Chief William Berens and Henry L. Masta. Of interest is Hallowell's correspondence with his former student Nnamdi Azikiwe, who invited Hallowell to speak at his installation as Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief of Nigeria in 1961 (see also Series II, Nigeria; and Series III, "To Nigeria"). The series also includes personal correspondence with Dorothy Kern Hallowell, Hallowell's first wife and the mother of William H. Hallowell, during the time when their son was incarcerated at the Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia.</p>
                    <p>Series I is arranged alphabetically by correspondent's name and then chronologically within each folder. When a correspondence file includes letters to a third party (i.e., not Hallowell), the name is indicated on the container list by using an indent under the folder title.</p>
                    <p>Unidentified correspondence has been filed as "Unidentified" and is arranged chronologically. Enclosed manuscripts have been removed from this series and placed in Series III or IV as appropriate. As with the reprints, a photocopy of the title page was filed with the original letter. Letters of reference are filed under the name of the person who is the subject of the letter.</p>

                    <p>contains handwritten and typed notes and drafts of published and unpublished reviews, lectures, articles, and a handbook. This series is arranged alphabetically by title. The earliest work is Hallowell's master's thesis (1920), "The Problem of Fish Nets in North America." The latest is an unpublished lecture titled "Bear Ceremonialism in the Northern Hemisphere: Reexamined," which was given at Bryn Mawr College in 1968. Much of the material comprising this series represents Hallowell's later publications, e.g., "The Rorschach Technique in Personality and Culture Studies" (1956); "The Backwash of the Frontier (1957); "Rorschach Protocols of 151 Berens River Adults and Children and 155 Adults from Lac du Flambeau" (1957); and "Hominid Evolution, Cultural Adaptation, and Mental Dysfunctioning" (1965). For each work, the notes, drafts, and published versions are filed together.</p>

                    <p>contains field and reading notes taken by Hallowell, his students, and colleagues; as well as some course materials. The bulk of the field notes include ethnological observations, folklore, Rorschach Tests, and drawings of the Ojibwa-speaking Native Americans in Canada (Berens Rivers Saulteaux) and Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin. Other major subjects of this series include the Abenaki, marriage and the family, nets and netting, bear cult, self and ego, and Rorschach methodology and materials. The earliest dates in this series refer to the dates of publications from which Hallowell made reading notes. These notes concern general aspects of the history and culture of Native North Americans, as well as clippings depicting them in Euro-American art and literature. This series is arranged alphabetically by subject, and the folder labels reflect Hallowell's original spelling and wording, e.g., terms such as "Indian" are retained. Materials filed under the same label in consecutive folders were kept in the original order in which they were received; thus, materials may not appear in order by date. Also included in this series are three card file boxes. Box 1 contains cards on Ojibwa families of Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin, which note the names of family members, their birth dates, and their tribal affiliations. Cards are arranged alphabetically by family surname, and each family member listed under the surname has been assigned a serial number. At the end of the alphabetical arrangement, individual family member cards are arranged numerically by serial number. Box 1 also contains reading notes on the history of Native Americans in Wisconsin, as well as a bibliography of Ojibwa myths and tales. Box 2 contains a Rorschach bibliography. Cards are arranged according to topics, e.g., "Children," "Aptitude and Talent," and "Special Studies." Box 3 contains a bibliography of literature concerning Native Americans. Cards are arranged first by topic, e.g., "Short Story," "Dime Novel," and "Captivity Stories." Authors of works under each topic are then filed alphabetically.</p>

                    <p>Contains photograph albums, loose prints and negatives taken by Hallowell or others, or given to him during the course of his career. This series also contains reproduction photographs and copy negatives (total 27 boxes) made for research purposes, along with photocopies of most of the reproduction photographs and log sheets. A description of each reproduced item is included in the appendix as well as a detailed narrative of the photograph conservation project.</p>
                    <p>Researchers seeking to view images from Subseries A-F are requested to use the reproduction photographs.</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph render="bold">Organization of reproduction photographs to be used for research use:</emph></p>
                    <p>The photographs and negatives that pertain to Hallowell's research on Native Americans in the United States and Canada were chosen for reproduction (Subseries A-F). Postcards were not reproduced. Each unique image in Subseries A-F has a research photograph and a copy negative. The research photographs have been reprinted from the original negative when possible.</p>
                    <p>The photographs have been organized to follow the order of the original photograph albums as closely as possible, with the exception of Subseries F. Basic arrangement for Subseries A-E is from left to right and/or top to bottom, depending on the photograph's original placement on the page. Subseries F, which consists of loose prints never included in an album, has been grouped by approximate geographic location or subject matter as described in the description of each reproduced item.</p>
                    <p>The reproduction photos are housed individually in polyethylene sleeves along with a stabilizing acid-free board. A label affixed to each board gives the unique number of the image, the tribe or group, location, names of people, dates, cross references to other similar images, and any other information that can be found on or with the photograph or supplied by outside researchers.</p>
                    <p>Hallowell's personal comments, sometimes written on the verso of prints or on envelopes containing images, are the primary source for identification. Comments provided by other sources are enclosed within brackets, and when available, the outside sources have been noted. The amount of information provided varies. For instance, in Subseries A, many times a group picture has only one person identified, and thus that name is the only one on the label. In contrast, most of the individuals in Subseries E are identified.</p>
                    <p>All the photographs are considered to be taken by Hallowell unless otherwise noted. Some photographs in Subseries A were taken by Steve Boggs. The photographs in Subseries D may have been given to Hallowell by Frank Gouldsmith Speck.</p>
                    <p>Native American Images Note : Over 1,500 black &amp; white silver gelatin photographs of Ojibwa, Abenaki, and Mohegan tribes of Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. Taken by Hallowell from ca.1920-1940 to support his ethnological research, the images are primarily portraits of individuals located outside their respective dwelling or settlement wearing some cultural accessories. Organized in subseries lettered A-J, subseries E and F illustrate artifacts such as drums, canoes, baskets, papoose and utensils. Of note are many prints of dome and pointed wigwams. Subseries I and J contain over 150 black and white postcards of Aztec, Navajo, and Hopi pottery, dwellings, and sculpture.
