Had the pleasure of discoursing with Franklin's brother in his pass through his place. Trusts that notwithstanding Mr. Franklin's gifts of Nature, he may be kept humble and be enabled to improve his uncommon genius for God's glory, his own and others' benefits.</p>

Regrets the price he mentioned for the seal, the work being far more than he expected; however, will stand strictly to his bargain, and trusts to his generosity to pay the extra amount.

                        <p>Acknowledging his bill, also the pamphlets sent the summer before. Pleased with Dr. Hamilton's generous defence of good Dr.Thompson, Begged Mr. Franklin's "Plain Truth" of Mrs. Mecom, as he had never seen it. Mr. Kinnersley well-received; through him, has seen some of Mr. Franklin's entertaining experiments. His opinion of this new found element [electricity]. Thinks Mr. Franklin's Rationale on Clouds and Rain, and also on the Aurora Borcalis, appears extremely probable. Would transmit his own observations on the 'Fulmen' if he has the leisure to look at them. Has bad a cold winter. Boston threatened with epidemic of small-pox; Some persons trying tar-water as a preventive; would gladly try anything Mr. Franklin may have heard of, but differs from his brethren in the affair of diet. Wishes him all the happiness in his son that his genius and accomplishments seem to promise.</p>

His political opinions; his admiration for the English Constitution; thinks America in greater danger from Popular Licentiousness than from any abuse in their governors, though some of them have been bad enough. Lord Halifax's approval of his conduct. Exceedingly pleased with Franklin's observations on "The Increase of Mankind"; the last paragraph being the only one liable to exception, thinks it a pity it should end the discourse. Has been revising his own Principles in order to challenge all opposition. His son David pleased with Mr. Franklin's notice of his performance. Sends Pike's book by his son, Alexander.</p>

                        <p>Sent a long letter to Mr. Penn containing the scheme for Franklin's Academy and the arguments for it. Mr. Penn has come into every part of it and will give a yearly sumy for some time, and when he comes to Pennsylvania intends to give a manor to the Academy for certain purposes. The proprietor had a design in view of his own, of which he intended to be the founder, but after argument, agreed to ingraft his scheme upon Franklin's in the two foundations proposed, provided Mr. Smith would be the person to execute them. To this he agreed, trusting that it would be welcome to the trustees. Sees a great deal of Mr. Penn, who consults him on every point that relates to literature in hiscountry. His letter laid before the Society entrusted with the moneys for the Germans, and they are satisfied that the education of youth ought to be their more immediate object. The management of this important trust should devolve upon men of the first rank of Pennyslvania and not upon clergy who depend on Dutch synods. Hopes to see all such dependence shaken off once they can supply the Germans with ministers from the Academy. Outline of the scheme which he has laid before the Society. Smelled out and broke the neck of Mr. Tennent's scheme, which was for the benefit of the Jersey College, by monopolizing the education of German clergy. His proposition of a German professor of divinity at the Academy to prevent this scheme of drawing the Pennsylvania Germans to the Jersey College. The Proprietor has agreed to give ten or twelve acres of land to every schoolmaster. Has drawn out a short memorial of the case of the Germans without any reasonings or education, which is to be distributed and collections solicited in both houses of Parliament. He doubts not the contributions will amount to a great sum, his Majestry having given B#1,000 and the Princess Dowager B#100. The Archbishop has greatly encouraged him. Col. Martin, of Antigua, if Mr. Smith returns, will send his youngest son to the Academy, and Mr. Penn talks of sending out a nephew. He (Smith) will return with a formed scheme and an appointement of trustees.</p>

As requested, has shipped the paper to Jamaica. Holland hopes to finish the whole of the Almanack by the middle of August; has sent him vermilion and paper. Trusts his father may have no cause to regret leaving him the arrangement of the Post-office. Asks to have his name entered as subscriber for the second volume of Prince's Chronology.</p>

                        <p>Acknowledging Mr.Franklin's letter of 4th ult.; will endeavor to make the best use of the seasonable intelligence therein contained. Proofs of zeal given by the Assembly of Pennsylvania; injustice of certain imputations. Asks for a statement of certain accounts in Pennsylvania since the commencement of the present troubles, that the colony may receive proper considertaion when the matter comes before Parliament. Gov. Morris has at last communicated his instructions; cannot say what will be thought at the claim; hopes the Assembly will not be divested of a privilege. Sorry for the unhappy state of affairs in Europe; greatly concerned at news of the military reinforcements sent from France into North America.</p>

                        <p>Acknowledging letter of June 9th. Uncertain when this letter will leave, so wishes merely to acknowledge his kindness in looking after his money. Successful expeditions everywhere against the French; Niagara, Ticonderoga and Crown Point being reduced, thinks the same results may be expected at Quebec; the French intimidated by such rapid conquests. Sends affectionate remembrances to Billy.</p>

Concerning a bill sent up to the Governor, to enable the agents to receive monies, which have been or may be allotted to this Province upon the Parliamentary grants. Stormy state of affairs; everything in the present crisis depends on Franklin; if only the principal Acts he confirmed, their future controversies with the Proprietaries will be made more easy. Encloses copy of the aforementioned bill with the Governor's amendment.</p>

                        <p>Acknowledging favor of Dec.9, 1761, by Dr. Shippen. Their correspondence interrupted for many years by the war; delayed answering his letters in hopes of hearing some new discovery in electricity that he might impart; since the last edition of Dr. Franklin's works, has given up all electrical experiments; gives four reasons why; M.Le Roy of the Royal Academy of Sciences has long upheld Franklin's theory of electricity against M. I'AbbC) Nollet. Defense of the latter's theory by M.Dutour. Recalls the letters printed in 1753 by I'AbbC) Nollet in opposition to Franklin's. Delighted with Dr. Shippen; politeness he has shown him. M. de Buffon begs him to ask Mr. Collinson to send him seeds of trees in Pennsylvania for the Jardin des Plantes; suggests applying to John Battram. [Here MS. is badly mutilated.] Begs him not to leave Europe without a visit to Paris; offers to get him passports.</p>

                        <p>Glad to hear of his safe arrival. Has been chosen to Parliament for Weymouth. Expects to complete his work during the summer. The Speaker frequently inquires after Franklin. Can get no satisfactory information about Mr. Barker or his family; if the heir was in the East India service, can easily procure intelligence of him. Not surprised at the joy universally expressed on Mr. Franklin's arrival in Philadelphia. His letter, containing an account of Madeira, most welcome, he being one of the committee to inquire into its state. Concerning the Act of Assembly received from Mr. Moore.—Question of certain monies allowed Pennsylvania by the Treasury for her defence in 1760 and 1761.</p>

Lord Shelburne's interest in Franklin; on his being appointed Lord of 'I'rade, desired any information Franklin could impart, relative to the public good of his Province; since then a turbulent routish faction occasioned his resignation; he is still the King's favorite and must always have interest everywhere; advises Franklin to write to him and to ignore his resignation. Messages to his wife, son and daughter,— is the last-named married?</p>

                        <p>Has not had a line from him since his letter of Aug. 8th. His son brought home ill from Eton, but all that is happily over. Lord Egmont's preferment and Lord Hyde's appointment in his place; will carry out his wishes with the latter if possible. Party feeling running high. The Ministry sure to carry their point in Parliament regarding Wilkes; the result in Westminster Hall less certain. Concerning money matters. His interest in Franklin's son, now Governor of New Jersey. Messages from various friends.</p>

                        <p>Greatly concerned to hear of Franklin's misfortune but hopes by this time the cure is perfectly effected. Concerning some business connected with a grant which he is negotiating for Dr. Franklin with the Messrs. Coxe; search for original draught. Parliament meets on Tuesday, Mr. Wiles' business will come up then; House of Commons will probably express resentment at the use he has made of their privilege; session likely to be one of great heat and animosity; fears something relative to America will be done, very much against his opinion. Question of duty on molasses; will oppose all inland duties laid by Parliament on the colonies. Province of Pennsylvania excluded from all share of the money granted by Parliament for the service of 1761; fears this is not the only ill office the General has done the Province. Mr.Penn on his (Jackson's) side in this matter.</p>

                        <p>Has had only one letter from him in a great while; hopes he is effectually cured; with such news, could make one thousand people happy. Lord Hyde to take Lord Egmont's place, Lord Halifax has now the administration of American affairs; this mutability no proof of an unstable Ministry. Has a good deal of access to Mr. Grenville, who is at the head of it. American affairs in a critical situation. Thinks Maj. Barker at Manila is the gentleman sought after by Franklin; expects him in England in February on March. Difficulty of the work connected with Messrs. Coxe's application; various other claims to the land. His opinion that the mother country is mistress of the trade of its colonies, that she may prohibit foreign trade and may therefore tax; dreads internal taxes. Messages to Mr. Galloway. Mr. Allen's stand on behalf of the Province. Discusses Indian war. Agrees with Franklin about a plethora of money. People's estimate of Col. Bouquet. Encloses list of Acts sent him by the Agent for the Proprietors. Dr. Pringle's reasons for declining any concern in their scheme.</p>

                        <p>Has written him by every packet. Maj. Barker's arrival in England, his intention to sail for America in April, then to take possession of and cultivate his estate; has recommended him to certain friends in America. Several American questions coming before Parliament; constantly occupied comhating dangerous errors in American politics; results not commensurate with his efforts. Has long since given up hope of preventing some Parliamentary tax on North America for the maintenance of troops kept there; his aversion to internal taxes. Customs and prohibitions in trade date from the Long Parliament; wishes this to be the rule of England's conduct on this occasion. A bill in embryo for restraining the paper currency of North America within certain limits; will undoubtedly be carried.</p>

Number of Indians in the vicinity; two thousand warriors in the Cherokee Nation who desire peace; also anxious to aid in any movement against the Creeks,who number three or four thousand fighting men. A report that the Creeks have refused to give up the late murderers as demanded by the Governor; more mischief expected from that quarter.</p>

Flatters himself that Franklin's zeal will not be exclusively devoted to the correction of abuses in his own Province. Rhode Island but a burlesque on order and government, and not likely to improve unless the Constitution is altered; a petition to the King now in the hands of Jos. Harrison who sailed three weeks back; thinks it may be in Franklin's power to facilitate this matter. Has lost a valuable and affectionate wife.</p>

His high opinion of Mr. Allen's honesty and good sense; this and other reasons induced him to open his mind to him more freely than he should, on the subjects of Pennsylvania's privileges, the proprietary Government, the power of the Crown, etc.; had no idea that Mr. Allen would make these sentiments public; intended chiefly for Franklin's ear. Has just heard of the event of the election; not sorry for Franklin, but only for the Province; looks upon all hopes of reconciliation as vanished. Messages to the Governor of New Jersey.</p>

                        <p>Concerning the best means of pickling sturgeon. The best machine for uprooting trees; Franklin's idea of pulling them down by a force applied to a straight rope appealed strongly to the writer's namesake, the Virginia professor. Must have seen by the newspapers the death of Mr. Bliss, the Greenwich observer; Mr. Mitchell has unsuccessfully offered himself as a candidate; thinks the Tory interest will get it for an Oxonian who never made an observation. Rival geniuses apt to be highly jealous of one another; cites the case between Cumming, the watchmaker, and Mr. Harrison. The affair of the B#5000 which was to have been given to Mr. Harrison; the law says that he is entitled to B#20,000 for his discovery. England's relation to America; Franklin's friends hope he will put on paper his thoughts on this subject.</p>

Names of men left out of the Commission and one or two put it. After careful reflection, thinks nothing can contribute to their freedom so much as a Legislative Council; reasons for this.

                        <p>Urgent business called him away and so prevented him from waiting on Franklin at Chester; hopes ere now he is safe in London. The first day of his journey traveled about thrity-two miles up the Lancaster Road and passed nineteen taverns; thinks to this fact is due the widespread debauchery and useless dissipation of time and money; cites the story of Cyrus and the Lydians to prove this; much better if the Governor could have a handsome fixed annual salary, instead of perquisites arising from tavern licenses. Wm. Moore put at the head of the Commission in Chester Co.; other changes made show the effect of party spirit. Reason to fear that the Indian war is not at an end; six Shawanese hostages have made their escape; trouble expected. Before Mr. Hamilton sailed, heard rumors that the Presbyterians had signed a petition to the Proprietaries requesting their influence to prevent a change of Government.</p>

                        <p>Account of the escape from Pittsburg of the Shawanese hostages; this tribe independent owing to being supplied by French traders with clothing and ammunition; no permanent peace possible until that country is taken and an English garrison established at the Illinois; one, Owens, was sent by Col. Bouquet to invite the hostages to return; an altercation ensued and Owens shot one of them dead on the spot. Delawares and Mingos desirous of having the peace confirmed. First division of the Pennsylvania forces to be disbanded, the other on its way to Carlisle. Faction at present in high spirits, declares openly that there is not the least fear of a change of Government; his father praying for that change, which only can restore peace to the distracted province.</p>

                        <p>Acknowledging favors of Sept. 26th and Nov. 9th Confident that everything has been done to obtain the desirable object, —a Royal Government; hopes the presentation of the petitions will bring forth the desired issue. Thanking him for the notice taken of the piece signed Americanus; has nearly finished a pamphlet on the same subject entitled "Political Reflections on the dispute between Great Britain and her Colonies respecting her right of imposing taxes on them without their assent"; if Franklin's son approves, will publish it; something needed to allay the violent temper of the Americans; difficulty of getting it published; printers take everything inflammable but nothing cool and rational. Concerning a petition to the Commons for the repeal of the law prohibiting paper money from being lawful tender in the colonies; reasons why Parliament would do well to grant it. Impatiently awaiting the resolution of Parliament respecting the Stamp Act; mischief caused by the delay. Thinks there is a wide-spread intention to throw off all connection with the mother country; is confident this will meet with little sympathy in Pennsylvania.</p>

                        <p>Enclosing a letter to the sieur Lomonozow at Petersburg which Franklin is to read and suppress if he likes. Curious to have an account of the discoveries of the polar voyage. His endeavors to obtain thermometrical observations from each one of the sixteen Continental provinces; fears it will be a failure owing to lack of thermometers. A detailed account of certain experiments, after M. Braunius, in the congelation of mercury. The winter one of intense cold. Hopes he will not forget to recommend that ingenious gentleman, Mr. Professor Winthrop, to the honors of the Royal Society.</p>

Inhabitants of Cumberland County guilty of an act of rebellion ten days previous; a full account of the whole affair will be transmitted to him. Rumors from Third Street, that the Proprictor has yielded to the importunity of the Pomfret family to sell the Government to the Crown for a peerage; not anxious about the means, if the end is obtained.</p>

Samuel Smith of Burlington has been composing a history of New Jersey; has planned to go there and print it for him; intends sending Ben Mccom's printing materials there; will pay Franklin for them if he wishes it. Intends leaving the printing office and little post office at Woodbridge to his son. Hopes he will be able to pay off his debts before his death. Has had a smart attack of gout. Excessively cold winter; great poverty throughout the country. Question of his losing the comptroller's office, unless he moves to New York; reasons why he cannot live there; hopes the place of comptroller will not be taken from him; if it is unwilling to keep the post office at Woodbridge, as it does not pay him.</p>

It is said that W[illiam] A[llen] has a letter from the Proprietor, declaring his intention to hold the Government and quoting the King as his authority; does not believe this, but it has added new spirits to their party. The affair of spiking the guns; accusations against various parties; the one man apprehended is probably innocent. Aversion shown by most people to have representatives in Parliamebt; reasons for it. Case of a small compact settlement about 30 miles from Pittsburg on land not yet purchased from the Indians; unless these persons are removed, it may cause another Indian war.</p>

                        <p>Enclosing a general statement of accounts, and acknowledging a short letter from Franklin by Capt. Robinson. Discusses some money matters in which he seem to have expected a more generous treatment at Franklin's hands. The use he made of B.Mccom's printing materials he is willing to pay for; Mecom's effects remain in store house in New York, awaiting Franklin's orders. His health failing but endeavors to be resigned, knowing that it cannot be long before he goes hence.</p>

                        <p>Acknowledging his letter by Capt. Robinson; the case of the Duke of Athol a curious one; still more curious are Mr. Pownall's reasons for refusing the Government, through they do credit to that gentleman. Sends the enclosed Resolves of the Lower House of Assembly of Virginia, on the Stamp Act and the right of the British Legislature in forming that law; after they were passed, the Governor procured the original minutes, tore them up and instantly dissolved the Assembly. The hopes of a change contained in Franklin's last letter give great joy. Thanks him for his efforts to see aside the intended application for the Delaware Islands.</p>

                        <p>Acknowledging favor of 9th ult. giving an account of Mr. Mecom's affairs; thinks that young gentleman is much to be pities; considers that Franklin has acted generously in suffering Mr. Mecom's effects to be equally divided amongst his creditors. Asks him to recommend an honest attorney in New York, as one James Parker owes him a good deal of money. Mr. Robert Alexander stands as candidate for the horough of Anstrather in the place of Sir Harry Erskine.</p>

Hillegas and Henry Pawling; thus it has fared throughout the Province, except in Berks, where they lost their worthy friend John Ross. Arrival of the Vessel with the Stamped paper created much confusion and disorder; inhabitants gathered at the State House by beat of drum; their object, the destruction of J. Hughes or the surrender of his office; it ended in his promising to resign, J. Dickinson, G. Bryan, and J.

                        <p>Acknowledging favor of 19th August. Meetings like the one relative to the Stamp Act, held in New York, may in future be of great service to America. Refers him to his letter of the 5th ult. to see the result of the elections. In the new election for the city held to determine whether J. Pemberton or G. Bryan was elected, the former was chosen by a large majority; reasons for this. An association formed and articles signed by a great number of merchants, declaring they will not import from Britain any goods or merchandise until the Stamp Act is repcaled; thinks this method far more eligible than the imprudent and unwarrantable steps taken by several Colonies. Account of the populace in New York having assembled to the number of thousands, burnt the Governor's coach and obliged him to give up the Stamp papers, which they are determined to send back to London; seeing the multitude resolved. G. Gage advised the delivery; they also destroyed all the furniture belonging to Major James, who had said he would enforce obedience to the Act. Hourly expect some person to call on B. Chew; will then know what part he will act; he is considered as Probate of Wills, King's Attorney and Recorder of Philadelphia.</p>

                        <p>Hard pressed for time owing to a vessel's sailing early the next morning; is obliged to write to the Lords of Trade to acquaint them with the situation as regards the Stamp Act; has found it difficult to steer safely between the people in America and the Ministry in England; none of the Governors have received the least directions with regard to their conduct at this critical time. Congratulates himself that the Proprietary party published those lies against him, thereby giving him an opportunity, by a seasonable answer, to remove the prejudices of the people; stands well with them now; their resentment directed against the Speaker; gives reasons for this. At the last meeting of the Council, Mr. David Ogden moved that he (the Governor) should call the Assembly without an application on the part of the members; means he took to avoid this; thinks Gov. Bernard and Gov. Colden, by unneccssary officiousness, have made matters much worse; considers any man who sets himself up as an advocate of the Stamp Act in the Colonies, is guilty of a mere piece of quixotism; discusses the feasibility of ignoring the Stamp Act.

                        <p>Four years ago, his correspondence with springett Penn began, concerning his affairs in America; faithfulness with which he has attended to his concerns; hears from a gentleman of undoubted credit, that the Proprietor has been treating with his nephew for the purchase of Pennsbury Manor; thinks this unfair; not only would he (Penington) lose his commission, but is sure Mr. Penn will not get the worth of his lands. Has reason to believe that Thos. Penn has prejudiced his kinsman against him; asks Franklin to rectify this. Need of surveying the land accurately before selling; mean artifices practised to cheat the elder branch of the Penn family.</p>

Case of Mr. Cunningham, an attorney at Quebec, who was suspended by the Governor without any stated cause; the real reason was his opposition to the Governor on this same question; asks Franklin to give him an audience on this subject, when he arrives in England.</p>

                        <p>Esteem themselves very happy in having a friend like Franklin, who will represent their characters in a favorable light, to their relation, the Bishop. Franklin's advice to send Mr. Burrows a present of sturgeon or apples with their letter of thanks, came too late, the letter having gone; however, will ship them at once. Concerning Miss Sally's harpsichord whose machinery is so complex that no one could keep it in order but the man who made it; as Miss Sally plays so well, suggests the advisability of buying her a new one. Has finished the translation of the Psalms of David to the great satisfaction of the Dutch congregation at New York.</p>

Although he [Mr. Chew] "disapproved in the most modest manner of the Stamp Act, " is looked upon with disfavor by the advocates of extreme methods. In New York the stamp papers were burned. Read a letter from Mr. Conway, Secretary of State to the Governor of Rhode Island, couched in the strongest terms, demanding the people's submission to all acts of the English Legislature and calling upon Gen. Gage and Lord Colville, in case force is needed, to maintain order and good government; trembles for the consequences. Finds himself in hard straits for money; would be much indebted to Franklin if he could procure him a place in any department in a Colony north of Carolina.</p>

                        <p>Proprietary party say openly that there will be no change of Government; all he and his friends can urge are Franklin's integrity, capacity, and his assurance that the petitions are not rejected. Certain men on the Court side only lie in wait to augment the least omission on Franklin's part; the December packet having brought two letters from Franklin to Joseph Galloway and none to the Committee of Correspondence, they declare it contrary to his instructions and are endeavoring to prejudice members of the Assembly against him. Parson Millenburg denies that the letter mentioned before was read in the Dutch church. James Tilghman's appointment to the land office in place of William Peters, gives general satisfaction. Informed that the Courts are to be opened that week.</p>

                        <p>Acknowledging favor of Feb. 25th; fears his letter of the 16th was lost at sea; begs for a copy, if he has it. Keen satisfaction afforded Franklin's friends by the accounts of his examination at the bar of the House of Commons; prominent part played by him in the repeal of the Stamp Act; every merchant writes home as if he alone had accomplished the affair. Sensible letter from the Committee of Merchants in London, but all such advice is frustrated by the people's indiscretion. Is not surprised at Franklin's disapproval of his speech against the Proprietary officers, in answer to the Lodge paper; at such a distance, does not think a right judgment can be formed; all his friends think he acted rightly; Gov. Hutchinson thought the attacks on him 
                            <emph render="italic">beneath notice</emph>; the consequence was his house and effects were destroyed and his life endangered. Encloses two applications for favors from the Ministry: one from Col. Croghan, the other from Mr. Geo. Read. Account of a company formed by himself and others to purchase from the French certain lands at the Illinois. Does not want the Chronicle stopped. Betsy sends a cordial thanks for the notice taken of her nephew.</p>

On applying for his Master's Degree, an honor he was entitled to, his printer, a poor ignorant man, was summoned and examined as to political pamphlets he (Hunt) had written; later his application was refused, without hearing what he had to say; his ambition greatly checked by this cruel behavior.

                        <p>Joyous and satisfactory news of the repeal of the Stamp Act; universal pleasure it diffused. Illumination took place on the evening of the 20th; on the 21st a handsome dinner was provided at the Stadt House and concluded with much decency. There it was agreed that all who (from a patriotic spirit) had procured suits of home-made cloth should give them to the poor, and on the King's birth day appear in new suits of broadcloth made in England. The intention on part of a few to introduce in the Address to the King, Lords and Commons some remarks against the Proprietary Government. A plan conceived by himself and four others to purchase a chain of lots belonging to Springett Penn, which lie between 2d Street and the river Schuylkill; asks Franklin to find out Mr. Penn's price for these and also for Pennsborough Manor. Mentions names of those elected as managers for the work house, which is to be erected.</p>

                        <p>Transmitting a letter from the Committee of Correspondence, enclosing an Address from the Assembly to His Majesty; their objections to the Proprietaries not due to personal resentment, but to the unhappiness and injury their government has caused. Great opposition shown to a resolve giving His Majesty assurances of granting aids for the defence of the colonies; reasons for and against; finally passed. Describes the Governor's conduct during the late trouble; evident from Secretary Conway's letter to the Governor, approving of his conduct, "that his honor deceived Mr. Conway by a eulogium on himself which he did not deserve." malevolence of the Chief Justice against Franklin, as shown by public accusation in the House that Franklin was the greatest enemy to the repeal of the Stamp Act. Assembly's grateful sense of the firmness and integrity with which Franklin has served his country. Various considerations which point to the policy and wisdom of changing the Government from Proprietary to Royal. The Assembly, not suspecting that the petitions are rejected and being in debt, are anxious to push them to a conclusion.</p>

                        <p>Acknowledging favor of Apr. 6. Unjust treatment he has suffered at Mr. Holts's hands; recounts in detail every transaction he has had with Mr. Holt since their first meeting, at present it stands thus; if Holt will settle his debt to him within three months, well and good; if not, he will arrest him and start to print a rival newspaper. Complaints of the amount he earns as Land-Waiter, of the misfortunes he has had to struggle against, of Mr. Colden, his assistants in the post-office, and of many other things. Bulk of people still dispute authority from home; notwithstanding the late Act of parliament directing every Captain of a vessel to carry all letters to the post-office, the moment a ship comes in, the letters are seized by force and carried to the coffee-house where they are cried out and delivered.</p>

Thinks Mr. Colden rather too much of a gentleman for the due execution of the post-office duties. His son stronger.</p>

                        <p>News of a change of Ministry received with real concern; fears that it will prevent a change of Government; asks Franklin's opinion. Chief Justice declared publicly in the House that Secretary Conway had rebuked Franklin when he applied for a hearing on the petitions, and assured him that they were laid aside by His Majesty never to be resumed; does not believe this but would like the power to deny it. Uneasy about their poor friend H., who, owing to his having written many indiscreet things, is much disliked by both parties; wishes means could be found to raise him above the malice of his unrelenting enemies. The last election a complete victory; new mode of electing approved by both parties; prevents perjury and fraud. Joseph Wharton sends kindly remembrances.</p>

                        <p>Often recalls the first time he met and spoke with Franklin; sorry he was unable to show him some of his experiments in electricity. Prince Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, hearing of Franklin's proposed visit to Germany, was extremely anxious to see and speak with him; with this purpose in view, sent a friend to GC6ttingen to greet Franklin, but unfortunately arrived too late; the Prince anxious to have lightning rods placed on his houses; desires Franklin to describe accurately the method used in America, thereby gaining for himself honors and profit in Germany. Contemplates writing a history of electricity, in which work he wishes to print certain experiments and inventions of Franklin's; aware of the audacity of this request.</p>

Has spent three months with Sir William Johnson, where they had several conferences with the Six Nations; these express great uneasiness that the boundary between this hunting country and the middle British colonies was not confirmed; since the agreement made two years before with Sir William Johnson the English have made more encroachments on their country than ever before, and have killed several of their warriors. In consequence, a great meeting of the Indians is to be held in the Shawanse country, and he, Croghan, leaves at once for Fort Pitt to divert, if possible, this Council. The result likely to be war, unless the boundary is confirmed. Sir William Johnson has written of it to His Majesty.</p>

Has seen the Act of Parliament laying certain duties on paper, etc., imported into America, and appropriating these duties to the payment of Governors' and judges' salaries; thinks this measure may assist the desired change; his opinion of it. If the Governor and judges are to be independent of the people, as they are, it is best they should also be independent of the Proprietors.</p>

Sends him a supplement of Goddard's paper that he may see the steps the people in Boston Government are taking; fears consequences if England should act with her usual spirit; his opinion as to what would advance the interest of both countries. Stamp Act has raised a great spirit, especially to the eastward. At present, about 150 sail in port, but business very dull, and must grow worse. Asking Franklin's assistance in purchasing the rights from William Royden's heirs, of certain lands in the Province, for the heirs of John Smith. Recommends to Franklin the bearer of this letter, Enoch Story, as an honest, worthy man.</p>

                        <p>Informing him that he has sent him by Captain Falkner twelve bottles of wine and made from wild grapes on his own place; hopes it may warm the hearts of all who taste it with a love for America. Despairs of a change of Government until after the death of Thomas Penn; wishes he could be prevailed on to die for the good of the people, and thus make his name as immortal as Samson's death did his.</p>

                        <p>Acknowledging favor of August 5th and also Dr. Baker's ingenious investigation of the cause of Devonshire colic; he deserves the thanks of that country in particular and of all the world where wine and cider are drank; compares their own tendency to colic with that of other nations. Sends him a catalogue of the medical books in their library; thanks Franklin for the interest he has taken in the scheme. Account of the annual election; none now so hardy as to speak against Franklin. Question of the colonies manufacturing articles to rival other nations rather than Great Britain.</p>

                        <p>The affair at New Haven terminated by Holt having to pay Mr. Ingersoll B#48, which he has since done. If he can but hold out a year or two, expects to bring his newspaper through successfully; at present it's a hard struggle. Price of writing-paper higher, owing to the new duty, also his labors in the custom-house increased. Weyman continues in public service; his paper, a jumble of lies and truth, expressed in the vilest language.</p>

                        <p>Issue of trial of Post-Office vs. Holt. Has suffered lately with a fever and gout, but is now better. Concerning the payment of his salary in the Custom-House. The Thursday's post by way of Hartford to Boston is to be stopped; a rider from Hartford to New London will answer all purposes. Intends altering his paper to Monday; every day sees a slight increase. The new duties make a great noise on the continent, but no so much at home; the poor people complain much, and yet there is much luxury. Benny Mecom's failure to get along; expects nothing from that quarter. Assembly sitting, but ignorant what they are doing; Weyman still prints for them; thinks him an object of pity and contempt.</p>

Weyman has dropped his paper and has resigned his government work in favor of Hugh Gaine, who allows him one year's salary; his (Parker's) name was mentioned by some of the members, but it was objected that he was a Custom-House officer. Holt still avoids arrest. No hope of getting a copper of rent from Benny Mecom.</p>

The House improves every opportunity to urge the Governor to do his duty by bringing those wretches to the just test of the law. Prevalence of a disposition in the inhabitants of Cumberland Co. to support all persons who kill Indians; while this lawless disposition continues, there is little hope of peace with the natives. patterson's life in danger. A proposition that the Assembly shall give about £3000 to the northern tribes and the western Indians for the wiping away the blood of their warriors and relatives split at a time of peace. Their party stronger in the House than ever before; great hopes of a change of Government.</p>

Pays Franklin many compliments on the style of his writings in the periodicals; anxious to have these translated together with Franklin's examination, to be published in the "Ephemerides du Citoyen." Has announced the rough draft of this translation in the honorable assemblies at the house of the Marquis de Mirabaud. Sends explanation of his Chronological Chart, which Franklin was good enough to ask for. Acknowledges the Biographical Chart of Mr. Priestley. Thanks him for the strange nuts, — walnuts and hickorics. Wants to know if the liberty of the press in London or Philadelphia would permit of his printing an article on Deism, and if so, would Franklin take charge of it ?</p>

                        <p>Acknowledging favors of Jan. 9, 29, Feb. 13 and March 13. M[aurice] Morgan not yet arrived. Concerning Franklin's lands in Nova Scotia and his scheme of returning home via Halifax. Goddard has not yet published Franklin's paper on Smuggling, in the Chronicle, but has printed the one relative to disputes in America 1; both much admired, the latter far more than the Farmer's Letters. Concerning the experiment of setting water on fire. Reported by Mr. Foxcroft that Franklin was to be appointed one of the Under Secretaries of State to Lord Hillsborough; doubts the truth of this, but it is much wished for. Assures his father that in spite of great provocation, his one endeavor has been to avoid family quarrels. Question of paper currency. Evil consequences of the Ministry abandoning the posts in the back country, and leaving them to the colonies to garrison. Glad that the boundary is atlast to be completed. Sent an exact account of the manufactorics carried on in his province to Lord Shelburne; therefore cannot understand Mr. Grenville's complaints. Proves by statistics that there is not wool enough in the colonies to make each person a pair of garters. Act of Assembly for supplying the King's forces. Agreeable dinner he had with Mr. Bayard, meeting there Gen. Gage and Sir Henry Moore. Has just seen that Franklin has been chosen agent for Georgia; anxious to know if he will accept it.</p>

The pamphlet entitled "A Letter from Halifax" has involved him in a paper war and he has taken the side of the Mother Country against her ungrateful sons.

Party is high in Philadelphia and every measure of decency is renounced by the antagonists there. Mr. [Samuel] Ward elected Governor of Rhode Island.</p>

Has been in great trouble owing to her son Johnny's eyes; after being prevented some time by her husband, finally took him to Banbury to consult a famous gentlewoman there, who takes nothing for her services, but she said it was too late to do anything. Damage done by the late heavy rains to their present abode; hopes that Franklin and Mrs. Stevenson will not disappoint them about providing them with a better dwelling; mentions one in the middle of the town, in every way suitable.</p>

                        <p>The bearer is the young man Franklin desired him to inquire about; sketches his history. Mr. Spencer happily settled, owing to Franklin's recommendation. He (Timothy) is the most unpopular man in the Province, since taking a place in the post-office at the time of the Stamp Act. Flourishing condition of South Carolina; many improvements in Charleston. Lawyers, doctors and planters grow rich, merchants do not so well. Great confusion however prevails; people in the back settlements, calling themselves regulators, are in arms and acknowledge no authority; they owe their origin to "Grenville's hellish idea of an Stamp Act."</p>

                        <p>Pays Franklin many florid compliments on his greatness and learning. Asks his influence in procuring the title of LL.D. at one of the universities of Great Britain for his friend, Mr. Winthrop, professor of mathematics at Cambridge, N.E.; the incstimable advantage this will prove to Mr. Winthrop. His own sphere a small one; takes charge of a small flock in the sacerdotal way; for divertisement, enjoys a chase of beagle hunting. Gives Franklin news of his old friend, Harry Babcock.</p>

                        <p>Sees a number of pieces in the Chronicle, which he is sure are from Franklin's pen, especially two signed 'A Briton,' and one signed F.B., concerning the trade between England and the colonies; this latter Bradford has printed in his last Journal, also a letter from London wherein Franklin is said to have spoken in a large company against the right of Parliament to tax the colonies; thinks Bradford printed this to incense Parliament against Franklin. Enclosing copy of the lost Chronicle, containing two pieces signed Amor Patriae, said to be by one Crawley in London, also Lord Hillsborough's letter to himself and his answer unsealed. Same spirit still prevails in the colonies as before the sending of troops of Boston; nothing will make them acknowledge the right of Parliament to tax them. Notwithstanding Mr. Foxcroft's assertion, denies having said to anyone that Franklin continued in England this winter "at the solicitation of Lord Gower." Begs Franklin to send him Gov. Pownall's History of his Administration of the colonies and any other new publications. Mentions one or two petty instances of Lord Hillsborough's want of politeness to himself. Mr. Hughes retired to his farm where he writes letters of advice to the Ministry.</p>

                        <p>Reasons for thinking Franklin's letters have been intercepted. Boston people continue their attacks on Governor B[ernard] and the Commissioners, and have lately begun in the Journal of Occurrences to attack the military. A piece, signed Francis Lynn, supposed to be by Franklin, and much admired, has appeared in answer to Crawley's letter. Interested in a History of Electricity he saw at a friend's house, by Dr. Priestley; who is the author? Anxious to see the new edition advertised of Franklin's experiments; wonderful that he can find time for those studies. Employed reading books of husbandry as he excepts soon to move to his farm; desires some books on that subject, as well as certain others. Concerning a new plough lately invented for cutting trenches and making drains; urges its introduction into America. Best means of rooting up trees. Wants a good hand-mill. Young Dunlap has published an edition of the "Sermons to Asses" and to give them a sale has had the impudence to attribute them to Franklin.</p>

                        <p>Enclosing some remarks made by O. Biddle and Joel Bailey at Cape Henlopen on the late transit of Venus. Has not attended the meetings of the Philosophical Society since the two were joined and Franklin was elected President; thinks the eagerness the professors of the College showed for the union was to avail themselves of the labors of others and filch reputation from their knowledge; what confirmed him in this opinion. Gives data concerning parts taken in observing transit. A year previous sent Franklin, at the request of Wm. Henry of Lancaster, a draft of a register he had invented to regulate the heat in fireworks. Mr. Galloway's health. Capt. Dowell's widow, daughter of Franklin's old friend, Oswald Peel, sails for London. Recommends temperature, amid luxuries, to Mr. Wharton.</p>

The estimate gives the probable cost of carrying on the trade with the outposts as £60,898. If the trade be confined to the one post at Michilimakinac the cost would be much smaller but the Spaniards would work up the outposts. Greatly favors extension of the trade and recommends a plan of civil government for the district.</p>

                        <p>Has received copies of the English translation of his little "Code." The translation might well pass for the original, it is so well done. The work did not cause much sensation in Paris, but it was very well received in London, and a second edition is about to be published there. Has made many changes and additions since the first edition, which he hopes his translator will render into English. Requests Franklin to send a copy of the second edition in English to Miss Pitt, sister of the Earl of Chatham, to whom he is indebted for many kindnesses. Intends to publish also soon a "Digest of Humanity" or a commentary on the "Code," under the assumed name of M. Tone, of Philadelphia. Thanks Franklin for his kind reception of his friend, M. Frey, when the latter was in London.</p>

Quite happy at hearing that there is a favorable disposition in England towards the Colonies. Trade beginning to look up; an Act to encourage and extend the trade of America would be an act of grace indeed, worthy of the British Senate, and productive of great results at the time. Concerning certain accusations made against him; their probable source; account of a conversation with Mr. Blackburn in which the latter abused Franklin; some warmth occasioned by the writer's calling himself an American; stated his belief that a good American and a good Englishman were synonymous terms.</p>

                        <p>Informing Franklin of how their [Georgia] Assembly was dissolved by order of the Governor; same fate attended them in December, 1768. Cause for it: their having committed the Deputy Secretary, Mr. Moodie, for refusing to give evidence to the House in the case of the Deputy Surveyor-General for taking double fees in his office; this the Governor said the Assembly had no right to do. Trusts he has received the bills of exchange.</p>

Thanking Franklin for a new picture, a striking likeness of himself, presented to him by good Mrs. Franklin. On June 28 had a commencement in the College; the farce prettily played. Certain medical dissertations. A correspondence with the learned societies of Europe would prove an advantage to the [American] Philosophical Society.</p>

Concerning what Franklin mentions from Mr. Manduit relative to the dissenters. The Governor's reasons for dissolving the first Assembly; personal enmity against himself. Franklin's solicitations on behalf of the Negro law will be gratefully acknowledged by every well-wisher to the Province. Hopes all difficulties will be overcome respecting Sir William Baker's claim; warns him not to count on the Governor's assistance. Wishes Franklin had written to the Committee of Correspondence relative to public matters. As they were not dissolved with the House as Franklin imagined, his letters containing some matters of a private nature, he did not choose to send to them, and some of the Committee being those that assisted the Governor in using him (Jones) ill, he could not well in person communicate them; however he will contrive some method to acquaint them with what they have a right to know.</p>

                        <p>Finds that Mr. Jasper Mauduit has applied for Franklin's kind assistance to remove some grievances imposed on protestant dissenters; dispute between himself and the rector; encloses copy of letter published on that occassion; question of sexton's fees. Bill sent by the upper house to the lower, in which a rate is fixed on all dissenters to be paid to the rector, though his attendance is not required nor any duty performed; this received not a vote in the lower house. Refusal of upper house to hear a second reading of a bill passed in the lower to lay out a burying ground for protestant dissenters; expects a like bill in favor of the Jews will meet with the same fate. Unlucky in being a dissenter in political as well as religious matters.</p>

Concerning the grievous iniquities practiced towards the negroes; asks him to consider whether he may not be able to do something effectual towards the removal of that terrible evil; at the same time that he sent the tracts on the slave trade to Franklin, sent them to the most weighty of their friends in London; desired them to consider whether it might not be their duty to lay the iniquity and dreadful consequence of the slave trade before the Parliament. Realizes the opposition they are likely to encounter from those "who sell their country and their God for gold"; pleads the cause however with great cloquence and fervor; number of slaves in English colonies; many opposed to it in New England, and also in Virginia, who will add their weight to any reform.</p>

The application of Lord Rochford for a grant of the islands in the Delaware, although thrown aside, makes the petition necessary at the present time. The income from the rents of the island supports from 25 to 30 poor children in the Free School. Hope that this income will not have to be used in obtaining a confirmation of the title. Suggest that an instruction to the Governor to grant a patent would incur the least expense. Have no private interests to promote.</p>

                        <p>Work of printing the translation goes steadily on; asks some questions concerning experiments in electricity; desires to know what Franklin considers the simplest and best among the different electrical machines. Concerning the best manner of forwarding to him one or more sheets at a time of Franklin's new edition, as well as the pamphlet of M. Dupont, who sends him a thousand compliments, as does the Marquis de Mirabeau and M. Dalibard.</p>

Absurd behavior of old Wharton in sending one of his sons to ask him to sell his share of the land on the Ohia. Extraordinary conduct of Lord Dunmore in granting land on the Kanawa, after what he told Lord Stirling. Has small hopes of Dr. [Cadwalader] Evans' recovery.

Criticisms on Franklin's works. Change of address but not of residence. Number of people and learned societies to whom he sent copies of Franklin's works. Will send the dozen portraits with the six copies Franklin asked for. A paper read by M. Le Roy, at the reopening of the Academy of Sciences, on Electricity. Dined with the Marquis de Courtanvaux; he has a magnificent electrical machine . Hopes that the extract from the old Almanac of Pennsylvania will not only be applauded but will bear fruit. Mlle. BibC)ron, Mlle. Basseporte, and his wife all invalids.</p>

A prize to be offered for the best paper on the means of protecting houses and individuals from thunderbolts. Experiments of one Comus, a juggler, much in vogue on the Boulevards. Translation of Franklin's works much read by men of taste and discernment, but, lacking the favor of the libraries, they are not yet known to the public; has already received more compliments on his preface than on all his other works; of such value is it to soar in the shadow of Franklin's wings.</p>

                        <p>Being engaged in translation and compiling Franklin's works, has learned much about electricity. Many accidents by lightning have happened recently which could have been avoided by proper precautions. Has given much time and thought to the subject of how to avoid being struck by lightning under certain circumstances. Has designed a paratonnerre, resembling in shape a parasol, to be used while out of doors during a thunderstorm.</p>

                        <p>On the selection of a glass bottle, or jar, for the Leyden experiment. Explains why all kinds of glass do not possess the same properties, but differ greatly. Some kinds of glass are good conductors of electricity, whilst others are non-conducting. How glass can rarely be manufactured evenly and of uniform thickness, due to the uneven action of the heat in furnace.</p>

Much gratifted that the 'Edict' was of Franklin's writing; charged likewise with being the author of "The Method to make a Little State of a Great One"; Gen. Lee the only man who differs from this opinion. Concerning the accounts which Mr. Thomas Foxcroft transmitted to Franklin. Sent Mrs. Barry's letter to Mr. Cox. Can get no tidings of the Dutchman for whom Franklin forwarded a letter.</p>

Question of appointing an agent for their little colony [Rhode Island]; inconsiderable salary; if, however, Franklin would forget his real dignity and be so unconscious of his intrinsic worth as to deign to write Governor Wantoo, feels sure he would be solicited to accept the agency. He is often toasted in Connecticut. Tells him of a noted subterraneous prison (once a mine) in Linusbury, appropriated for the confinement of felons; calls it a hell.</p>

                        <p>Sorry to hear how matters are misrepresented at home concerning the poor Americans and also for the abuse Franklin has received in his faithful services to his King and country. If England sends over an army, believes force will be met by force. Wishes their good sovereign, King George, would take the advice of such counsellors as Lord Chatham. In all ages the consequence of oppression has been revolution. Let the Parliament only take ye duty off tea and not use any coercive measures to obtain satisfaction for the loss of it, and never turn their thoughts on taxing us in future. When the Crown wants assistance from her Colonies let her call upon them to raise men and money in their own way for the King's use, which he has no doubt will be cheerfully done as heretofore, and then harmony between the mother and her children will subsist.

                        <p>Acknowledging his favor of August 10th. Prospect of his going to London or of Franklin's coming to Paris. Franklin's departure at this crisis for America, will give umbrage to the British Government; begs him to come to France, which place has never been more tranquil. Confidence of the King and the people in M. Turgot, the new Comptroller-General; liberty of commerce; liberty of the press almost re-established; religion an exception to his rule. Concerning a series of papers he proposes to publish entitled "Le Correspondant de Philadelphie"; relies principally on Franklin to forward and enliven it.</p>

                        <p>Cannot understand why he has received no letters from Boston. Thanking him for the pamphlets; thinks it no profanity to compare Franklin to the "blessed Savior." Is as happy as the present state of affairs will permit, owing to Franklin's bounty. The unity of the colonies and the remarkable fruitfulness of the season seem like miracles wrought in their favor. Boston full of profligate soldiers; account of their shocking behavior. Thinks the Congress address to the people of England is a "grand performance," and does them honor. Mentions a "horrid lie" told and published about Franklin's son; had soon the pleasure of hearing it contradicted.</p>

Major Trent carries out with him the Restraining Act for Pennsylvania, New Jersey, etc.; efforts made not to have New York inserted therein.

                        <p>Concerning the payment of £100 from the Constitutional Society into the hands of Franklin's bankers, towards relieving the distressed inhabitants of Boston. Recent accounts from America tell of an unprovoked attack by the detachment of regular troops at Boston on the provincials, which reflects as little honor on the British military as their politics do on the British legislature. Hopes with the aid of Franklin's wisdom the Americans will maintain the rights of free though loyal subjects.</p>

Has recently received two letters from Dr. Rush. Is going to publish a periodical in the form of letters supposed to be written by a Quaker called Samuel Tone, from London, in which he will treat freely of all kinds of subjects. Has applied for permission to have these letters printed. The Royal Censor who examined the work was not severe on it.</p>

Entreats him to furnish his friends in England with all possible materials to do justice to their cause.</p>

Probability of the British inciting the Indians to butcher the inhabitants. Thinks the affection of the Indians might be unalterably secured if Congress should publicly assert and maintain the right of the natives to sell and convey their lands to the highest bidder; pernicious views of Government as manifested in the Quebec Act. Five regiments, containing in all 1,500 men, are soon to proceed from Ireland to America; hopes a future change of Ministry will bring about a reconciliation.</p>

                        <p>Takes expection to Franklin's remark, — "all tends to a separation." Represents the evil consequences to America of a break with England; enumerates the many past privileges enjoyed by the Colonies; terrible evils of war; hopes on the reassembling of Parliament something may be found to stop the progress of such an unnatural and destructive quarrel. In the Declaration of Congress he sees" that foreign assistance, if necessary, is undoubtedly attainable"; supposes this is merely a threat; evils of foreign interference. Probable suffering in store for America. Comments on the last petition of Congress to Great Britain. Prophcsics future trouble from the arming of the provincials.</p>

                        <p>News received of the capture of Quebec by their troops, assisted by 6000 Canadians. Burgoyne sails for London that very day; thinks if there is an honest mob left in London he and Gage cannot ride the streets in safety. Franklin will hear in Congress of their success at sea. Insists upon the condemnation of the Glasgow ship; every tittle of clothing on board needed for the soldiers. Trouble in retaining the Connecticut troops. Anxiously awaiting the results of the committe sent to Montreal; wishes Franklin could have been one of them. Splendid conduct of Gen. Montgomery and Col. Arnold. A play-house established in Boston, which opened with a tragedy; very possible it may conclude with one.</p>

                        <p>Enclosing a copy of General Lee's letter lately sent to Gen. Burgoyne, if Franklin approves it may be published in the newspapers. Longs to send him his and Lee's opinions of the military measures to be pursued in Canada. Deprecates so much wrangling about forms of government; let them first establish their freedom; let them not tarnish the glorious and successful Continental arms by timid conduct; Franklin does not need these arguments; they are for certain others.</p>

                        <p>Concerning the publishing of his letter to Gen. Burgoyne. A good deal surprised and a little shocked at the proceedings of the Assembly; Considers the "injunction of these gentlemen to their delegates to dissent from any resolve leading to independence ill-timed, impertinent and impolitic"; bad results to be expected from such a declaration. Wishes Franklin would send some man who has the reputation of being a soldier to Virginia,which is the weak point; explains the prejudice of the common people against any man who has not seen service; cites anecdote to prove their blind faith in the latter. Enlistments go on swimmingly; let them but get powder and Boston shall be theirs.</p>

Rails against the present fashion of small waists; longs to be in America where she may appear without distortion; comments on the extravagant manner of dressing the hair.

                        <p>British have left Boston in disgrace before the Colonial forces. Most of them just sailed this morning; where to is a secret. Our bombardment was unexpected, and the occupation of Dorchester Hill completed their consternation. Boston stands, but is much plundered. His own house looted. "Common Sense" is eagerly read and greatly admired. Colonies cannot be subdued by force.</p>

Informed that Lord Howe has joined the General before New York; expresses certain fears for the brave and generous sons of America. In high expectation of shortly seeing Burgoyne; he will find an enemy small in number yet brave by nature and longing to revenge the unfortunate affair at Three Rivers. Account of the troops under Col. St. Clair and himself. Strength of their naval force as compared with the enemy. His soldiers destitute of almost very necessary — shoes, stockings, shirts and soap — essential articles in an army; pleads for some method of sending on these things.</p>

                        <p>So far removed from the seat of government that very little intelligence reaches them. Informed that Lord Howe has joined the General before New York; expresses certain fears for the brave and generous sons of America. In high expectation of shortly seeing Burgoyne; hewill find an enemy small in number yet brave by nature and longing to revenge the unfortunate affair at Three Rivers. Account of the troops under Col. St. Clair and himself. Strength of their naval force as compared with the enemy. His soldiers destitute of almost very necessary—shoes, stockings, shirts and soap—essential articles in an army; pleads for some method of sending on these things.</p>

                        <p>Everyone, priests and lordlings, prostrating themselves before the idol of tyranny; the few honest men who sigh for the return of the troops are persecuted. The printer, M. Mesplet, the workmen and himself were dragged to prison and kept there 26 days without a trial. If Franklin thinks his sorrows worthy the attention of Congress, begs that it may be directed towards his friend, M. Mesplet. Obliged to quit America for London; leaves a translation of 'Common Sense' in the hands of M. Mesplet, and a letter on the affairs of the time; like the Jews who concealed their children from Herod, these must be hidden from the tyrant. Would willingly pour out blood as well ink for the success of the child of virtue and liberty. Posterity will place Franklin's name with Pompey. Brutus and Cato.</p>

                        <p>The ship of war, called the Reprisal, has been allotted to carry Dr. Franklin to the port of Nantes; the Reprisal is then destined to proceed against their enemies, and send any prizes captured to the ports of France; therefore asks Commissioners to make immediate application to the Court of France to grant the protection of their ports to American men-of-war and their prizes; if this application is crowned with success, he must then obtain leave to make sale of certain parts of those prizes; directions in case these requests are granted, also in case they are not. Recommends Captain Wickes of the Reprisal as a worthy man; he will treat prisoners with humanity and do honor to his appointment.</p>

                        <p>Shocked that America has become the seat of horror and bloodshed, a country destined for the abode of tranquility and the asylum for the persecuted. Finds himself often obliged to defend Franklin before persons who ascribe to him, in a great measure, this unhappy contest. Begs Franklin to let him hear some news of him. Dr. Priestley's second volume on air is full of new matter and opens a large field to philosophers. Describes in detail the new electrical machine by one Volta, over which there is much discussion. Announces his marriage to a Dutch lady only five years younger than himself. Hopes Franklin may be the means of bringing to an end this bloody contest.</p>

                        <p>Being an indirect sufferer in the cause of American liberty, ventures to write to Franklin. His misfortunes due to his having spoken and sometimes written his honest sentiments relative to Franklin's public ones. By the defeat of Lord Camden in the House of Lords he lost £10,000, as Franklin will see by the enclosed papers. Is now publishing by subscription "A Journey Through France," and entreats the honor of his name as well as those of the Continental Congress as subscribers. His motives not mercenary; they spring from a desire to have those names associated with his for future generations to see.</p>

                        <p>Asks Franklin's advice concerning a plan for fitting out a French ship to trade with America; his doubts as to the ulimate success of such an expedition; if Franklin approves would like some information about the ports of America and the nature of the cargo required; advantage to him to have some letters of introduction in Franklin's hand. Impresses on him the necessity for secrecy. Less self-interest than a desire to be useful to brave men, which animates him in this affair.</p>
