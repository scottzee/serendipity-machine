            <p>This volume consists of a handwritten draft of Caleb Alexander’s A Grammatical Institute of the Latin Language Intended for the Use of Latin in Schools. Although this work does not relate to Alexander’s better known missionary activities, this volume does give some insight into the public school movement in the early republic. After the American Revolution, state governments and individual reformers addressed public education with renewed vigor. This text is one of three Alexander wrote. He expected it to be assigned in public schools throughout the country. Its publisher, Isaiah Thomas gifted this volume to the APS.</p>

            <p>Caleb Alexander was born in 1755 in Northfield, Massachusetts, a town founded by his grandfather. He attended Dartmouth, Yale, and Brown Universities, receiving degrees from the last two. When he graduated from Yale in 1777, he studied theology and received his license to preach in 1778. He held various assignments in New England, but found his calling in preaching to Indian populations in New York.</p>
