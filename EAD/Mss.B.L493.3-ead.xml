            <p>The John Le Conte Papers contain a range of correspondence, most of which deals with discussions of natural history. Le Conte was a scientist whose interests were in natural history, especially entomology. Le Conte worked at the United States Army Corp of Topographical Engineers, and his correspondence relating to their surveys provide details on the state of eastern seaports and harbors in the mid-eighteenth century. Most of the correspondence is incoming and it is often either orders from superiors to Le Conte or field reports from subordinates to LeConte. The orders for Le Conte to organize an expedition to explore Florida are included.</p>
            <p>There is also a notebook on the course of study for cadets West Point. This appears to be a description of what is expected of cadets at the academy circa 1820. Expected courses taken, division of classes, and other administrative and academic information are included in the document. Subsequently, there is a multi-page fragment of a report on West Point written by Le Conte in 1821.</p>
            <p>Because all of the Le Conte Family Papers were all given to the APS at the same time, some of John L. Le Conte’s papers are included in his father’s collection, including information on John L. Le Conte’s work on the Honduran Interoceanic Railway.</p>
