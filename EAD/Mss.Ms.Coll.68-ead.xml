            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">Trained as an anthropologist at Berkeley under A.L. Kroeber and Robert Lowie, Carl Voegelin spent the majority of his career as a structural linguist specializing in Algonquian languages, including Delaware, Potawatomi, Fox, Menominee, and Shawnee, and on the Seneca, Ojibwa (Chippewa), and Blackfoot (Siksika). His most significant contributions came through his studies of Delaware, Shawnee, and Hopi, but he is also credited with reviving the 
                <title render="italic">International Journal of American Linguistics</title> after the death of its founder, Franz Boas, and with nurturing the program in anthropology at Indiana University, where he was on faculty from 1941 until his retirement in 1976. 
                <lb/>The Voegelin collection contains field notes, lexical files, notebooks, papers, correspondence, and other materials relating to Voegelin's work on Native American languages. The bulk of the collection concerns Delaware and Shawnee, but there is significant material for Blackfoot, Menominee, Ojibwa and Potawatomi, Seneca, and Penobscot. Notes on Turkish, kept during the Second World War, are also present. Among other important series in the collection are Voegelin's correspondence and notes concerning two of his major projects: the translation and interpretation of the Walam Olam and his study of Shawnee law. Correspondents include Leonard Bloomfield, Eli Lilly, and Morris Swadesh. A portion of the collection is indexed in Kendall (1982).</abstract>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Charles (Carl) Frederick Voegelin was an anthropologist and structural linguist best known for his studies of Native American languages. He was born in New York on 17 January 1906, the son of Charles and Elizabeth Herbst-Sepilius Voegelin. After earning his undergraduate degree from Stanford University in 1927, Voegelin received his PhD in 1932 from University of California-Berkeley, where he was a student of anthropologists Robert Lowie and Alfred Kroeber. Between 1933 and 1935 he received fellowships from the National Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies to pursue research as a post-doctoral fellow at Yale. In 1935, Voegelin was appointed Assistant Professor of Anthropology at DePauw University, where he remained until 1940. He also lectured at summer sessions of the Linguistic Institute held in Ann Arbor and Chapel Hill between 1938 and 1941.</p>
            <p>Voegelin began his long association with Indiana University in 1941 as Associate Professor of Anthropology in the Department of History. In the Bloomington Faculty Council memorial resolution to Voegelin (Indiana University, Circular 820-87), James Vaughan and Paul Gebhard note that the position "came about in part because Eli Lilly wished to see a small group of anthropologists and linguists address themselves to some problems of Indiana prehistory." This team of researchers, which included Voegelin's first wife Erminie Wheeler-Voegelin, developed a new translation and interpretation of the "Walum Olam." Voegelin was named Department Chairman (1947-1966) and Professor of Anthropology in 1947 at Indiana University, when the Department of Anthropology was established at Indiana, and Professor of Linguistics in 1964. In 1967, Voegelin was honored with the title "Distinguished Professor of Anthropology and Professor of Linguistics;" he served in this capacity until 1976, when he continued as Professor Emeritus at Indiana University and, after 1978, as visiting scholar at the University of Hawaii.</p>
            <p>Throughout his career, Voegelin made significant contributions to research and scholarship in his field. He authored several books, including 
                <emph render="italic">Tubatulabal Texts</emph> (1935) and 
                <emph render="italic">Tubatulabal Grammar</emph> (1935), 
                <emph render="italic">Shawnee Stems and the Jacob P. Dunn Miami Dictionary</emph> (1938-1940), 
                <emph render="italic">Hopi Domains</emph> (1957), 
                <emph render="italic">Linguistics and Anthropology</emph> (1975), and 
                <emph render="italic">Classification and Index of the World's Languages</emph> (1977). Numerous scientific articles by Voegelin have been published in 
                <emph render="italic">Language, The American Anthropologist,</emph> and the 
                <emph render="italic">International Journal of American Linguistics,</emph> a journal first edited by Franz Boas and edited by Voegelin from 1944 to 1980. Voegelin also initiated several new research ventures: the monograph series 
                <emph render="italic">Indiana University Publications in Anthropology and Linguistics</emph> and the journal 
                <emph render="italic">Anthropological Linguistics;</emph> a summer field station at Flagstaff, Arizona with the Museum of Northern Arizona; and the Indiana Archives of the Languages of the World. His activities in professional associations included serving as a member of the Executive Committee of the American Anthropological Association and as President of the Linguistic Society of America.</p>
            <p>In recognition of his many achievements, the American Anthropological Association honored Voegelin with the Distinguished Service Award, and Indiana University awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Letters. Voegelin died on 22 May 1986, survived by his second wife and professional colleague, Florence Marie Robinett.</p>

                    <p>Series I is arranged alphabetically by correspondent's name and then chronologically within each folder. When a correspondence file includes letters to a third party (i.e., not Voegelin), the name is indicated on the container list by using an indent under the folder title.</p>
                    <p>In a similar fashion, cross-references indicate when a piece of correspondence was originally found with materials filed in another series. Unidentified correspondence has been filed as "Unidentified" and is arranged chronologically. Enclosed manuscripts have been removed from this series and placed in Series III or IV as appropriate, and a photocopy of the title page was filed with the original letter.</p>

                    <p>contain primarily Native American vocabulary and grammar interspersed with texts and other field and research notes. Languages represented in this series are: 1 box of comparative Algonquian vocabulary and grammar; 2 boxes of Blackfoot; 5 boxes of Delaware, including 1 box of Munsee and 1 box of 
                        <emph render="italic">Walam Olum</emph> vocabulary, which is keyed to the Rafinesque translation; 1 box of Fox stems labeled "research assistant's notes from published sources"; 3 boxes of Menominee vocabulary collected by Slotkin (research assistant?); 6 boxes of Ojibwa, of which one box was collected by McGregor (research assistant?); 1 box of Seneca, Ojibwa and Penobscot; 4 boxes of Shawnee; and 1 box of Seneca. Arrangement in most boxes appears to be by word classes, i.e., according to stems, prefixes and suffixes. Card files have been left in the original order in which they were received, although metal fasteners and rubberbands have been removed. Folded items too large to remain in the cardfiles were removed and replaced with numbered photocopies. These originals were refiled in folders with the same title as the box from which they were removed, and the folders were placed in a standard-sized document box. Within each folder the originals are interleaved with sheets of paper; the sheet before each original bears a number that corresponds to the number of its photocopy.</p>

Works co-authored with another individual are filed in this series, and the co-author is noted on the outside of the folder. Marginalia and bylines in Voegelin's field notes and manuscript drafts indicate that he often collaborated with Erminie Wheeler and, especially, Florence Robinette. The series is divided into two subseries: III-A, Works Translated by Voegelin and III-B, Works Authored by Voegelin.</p>

                        <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                        <p>Contains three Native American texts that were translated and/or linguistically analyzed by Voegelin and which served as the basis of a publication by Voegelin. The texts are titled "Shawnee Episodes," 
                            <emph render="italic">Shawnee Laws,</emph> and 
                            <emph render="italic">Walam Olum.</emph> Erminie Wheeler-Voegelin collaborated with Voegelin in the fieldwork upon which these works are based. "Shawnee Episodes" includes thirteen autobiographical sketches of informant Nancy Williams, which were published by Voegelin in 1953 in an article titled "From FL [From Language] to TL [Target Language], Autobiography of a Woman." Files contain handwritten notes and typescripts of Shawnee transcriptions and English translations of the episodes. The text is arranged in numerical order, i.e., episodes 1-13, in three folders.</p>
                        <p>
                            <emph render="italic">Shawnee Laws</emph> is, according to the introduction, a "semiformalized text setting forth...standards of conduct for human relationships and...the mutual obligations between men and supernaturals." The handwritten title page states that the 
                            <emph render="italic">Laws</emph> were collected in the field in notebooks (see Ser. VI, Shawnee #17-25) in 1934 and dictated onto 31 audiotapes in 1952. Files contain handwritten notes and typescripts of transcriptions and translations. Versions of the draft are arranged into sections, roughly following the organization set forth in the introduction: introduction, playback version, dictated version (transcription only), dictated version (translation only), dictated version (transcription with translation), and notes. Folder #1 of "Section 7--Notes" includes part of a draft for the published article titled "Shawnee Laws: Perceptual Statements for the Language and for the Content" by C. F. Voegelin, John F. Yegerlehner, and Florence M. Robinett.</p>
                        <p>The last text in the subseries is 
                            <emph render="italic">Walam Olum,</emph> which is a record of the migration of the Lenape or Delaware Indians. Voegelin's translation of this work is used in 
                            <emph render="italic">Walam Olum or Red Score: The Migration Legend of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians</emph> published by the Indiana Historical Society in 1954. Manuscript and typewritten notes and drafts for this publication are contained in folders titled 
                            <emph render="italic">Walam Olum--Voegelin Translation.</emph> Other materials filed here include pictographs, supplemental studies, and a verse translation by an unidentified author. Translations of the 
                            <emph render="italic">Walam Olum</emph> by Daniel G. Brinton and Constantine Rafinesque are filed in Series IV.</p>

                        <p>Contains hand- and typewritten notes, outlines, and drafts of books, journal articles, lectures, grammars, and a book review by Voegelin. Arrangement is alphabetical by title. Two of the works in this subseries, 
                            <emph render="italic">American Indian Language</emph> and 
                            <emph render="italic">Language and Culture</emph> (also titled 
                            <emph render="italic">Language and Culture in Society</emph> and 
                            <emph render="italic">Language and Culture: From Ethnolinguistics and Sociolinguistics to Cognitive Ethnography)</emph> were intended for publication as books. Because large sections, including tables of contents and chapter and section titles, of these two manuscripts were heavily revised, drafts have been kept in the original order in which they were received. Occasionally, a section of one of the books appears to be marked for separate publication; in this event, the section is filed separately in subseries III-B under its distinct title and cross-referenced either to 
                            <emph render="italic">Language and Culture</emph> or 
                            <emph render="italic">American Indian Language.</emph></p>

                        <p>Contains unbound (see Ser. VI for bound texts) hand- and typewritten notes and drafts of transcriptions and translations of brief Native American narratives, songs, tales, and conversations. The texts are arranged alphabetically first by language and then by title of text. If the format of two or more texts indicates that they were intended to be kept together as a unit, e.g., consecutive page numbering, then the texts are foldered together and filed under the first title. The greatest number of unbound texts are in the Delaware files.</p>

                    <p>contains handwritten notes and texts, along with any handwritten or typed materials found in or with the notebooks. Languages of the Blackfoot, Delaware, Ojibwa, Pottowatomi, Seneca, and Shawnee are represented. The bulk of material in this series is in Shawnee (37 folders) and Ojibwa (24 folders). Shawnee notebooks primarily contain texts, and almost every notebook is accompanied by handwritten notes and typescripts of transcriptions and translations. Contents of the Blackfoot and Ojibwa notebooks were described in detail by Richard A. Rhodes, Department of Linguistics at the University of California-Berkeley, in 1988. Blackfoot and Ojibwa notebooks are arranged in the order of Rhodes' list, a photocopy of which is filed in the first Blackfoot folder.</p>

                    <p>Native American Images note : Colorful linguistic maps, in pencil and crayon, of the Potawatomi, Delaware, and Shawnee tribes to accompany the texts of C.F. Voegelin’s work on Algonquian languages. North American areas covered include Lower Michigan, Northern Wisconsin, Northern Indiana, and Central Illinois. One map covers the indigenous languages of Veracruz. Of particular note, a black and white silver gelatin print of a Potawatomi petroglyphic rock in Elkhart, Indiana. Primarily works by Voegelin, some maps were produced by his anthropology students. Some images are housed in Series III, IV, and Oversize.</p>
