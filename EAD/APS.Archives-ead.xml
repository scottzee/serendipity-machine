            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">Founded in 1743 by Benjamin Franklin, the American Philosophical Society was the first learned society in the United States. For over 250 years, the Society has played an important role in American cultural and intellectual life. Until the mid-nineteenth century, the Society fulfilled the role of a national academy of science, national library and museum, and even patent office. Early members of the Society included Thomas Jefferson, David Rittenhouse, Benjamin Rush, Stephen Peter Du Ponceau, George Washington, and many other figures prominent in American history. 
                <lb/> The Archives of the American Philosophical Society consists of 192.25 linear feet of material, organized into thirteen record groups dating back to 1743. The Society's archives extensively documents not only the organization's historical development but also its role in American history and the history of science and technology.</abstract>

            <p>In addition to the Archives, there are a number of manuscript collections that document the activities and history of the Society. The Library houses the papers of a number of members who were active in the Society, these include the Benjamin Smith Barton Papers (B B284), Albert Francis Blakeslee Papers (B B585), Henry Grier Bryant Papers (Ms. Coll. 38), Walter Bradford Cannon Papers (B C163.1), Hans Thacher Clarke Papers (B C55), Henry Herbert Donaldson Diaries and Papers (B D713; D713m; D713p), George William Featherstonhaugh Papers (B F31), John Fries Frazer Papers (B F865), Ebenezer Hazard Papers (B H338), John Frederick Lewis Papers (B L585), Francois Andre Michaux Papers (B M58.1), Robert Cushman Murphy Papers (B M957), George Ord Letters (B Or2), Joseph Priestley Papers (B P931), William Jacob Robbins (B R538), George Gaylord Simpson Papers (Ms. Coll. 31), and Elihu Thomson Papers (Ms. Coll. 74). Additionally, a few of the Society's officers have deposited their papers in the Library: George Washington Corner, III Papers (Ms. Coll. 11), William Ezra Lingelbach Papers(B L635), and Richard Harrison Shryock Papers (B Sh86). Material relating to the Society's Historical and Literary Committee can be found in the Peter Stephen Du Ponceau Papers (B D92p), as Du Ponceau was a driving force behind the committee's development of Native American linguistic material. The activities of the Society are also documented in the Jane Aitken Papers (B Ai9) - which were origninally part of the Archives (see II "Archives"), the John Fishbourne Mifflin Receipt Book (B M585), Samuel Rush's "Occasional Glimpses at the World, 1824" (B R895.o) - in which he comments on the Society and the Wistar Association, and in the Kane Miscellaneous Collection (B K13).</p>
            <p>Three other items that might be of interest include Alexander Graham Bell's address on "Aerial Locomotion" which was delivered before the Society on May 7, 1909 (533.6 B41a); James Bryce's personal reminiscences of Charles Darwin and of the reception of the 
                <emph render="italic">Origin of Species</emph> given before the APS on April 23, 1909 (B D25b); and Randolph Shipley Klein's 1965 master's thesis from Brown University, "The American Philosophical Society and the American Revolution" (506.73 Am4xk).</p>

            <p>The Archives of the American Philosophical Society consists of 192.25 linear feet of material, organized into thirteen record groups dating back to 1743. The Society's archives extensively documents not only the organization's historical development, but also its role in American history and the history of science and technology. This amassed documentation can be accredited to many of the Society's diligent secretaries who saved the Society's records and the Society's residence in the same building since 1789.</p>
            <p>The record groups are organized around specific categories, such as minutes and bylaws (I), Officers (V), and Financial Records (IX). Within each record group, sub-groups have been created around specific types of documentation. Sub-groups can vary in size from 1 volume to 5 linear feet, with the arrangement alternating between chronological and alphabetical. Early records tend to be better cataloged than later records. To date, the archives documents the activities of the Society through the mid-1980s. Records for the late twentieth century to present still reside with the office of origination.</p>
            <p>For the most part, the Archives documents the history of the Society and its many activities. The primary areas of interest are the Society's members and their regular meetings. Minutes and By-Laws (I), for example, is comprised of the records of early meetings and rules of the Society through the nineteenth century. Additional information on the membership can be found in Record Group IV - Members. The bulk of this record group contains records about members from the nineteenth century but does flow into the twentieth century. It includes letters of nomination, letters of acceptance, as well as biographical sketches and lists of attendance at meetings. Record Group X - Meetings - relates primarily to planning and programs for twentieth century meetings. The activities of the Society as an organization can be found in the record groups for Officers (V), Committees (VIII), and Financial Records (IX); the Society's activities as a collecting institution are documented in the materials for Curators (VI), and Library (VII).</p>
            <p>The Archives of the Society also provides a useful source for historians of science and technology. During the early years of the Society, papers on innovations in agriculture, technology, and science were presented at the meetings. Communications (III.1) consists of letters and papers on a variety of topics sent to the APS between the 1770s and 1830s. Many of the papers were read at meetings of the Society, some were published in 
                <emph render="italic">Transactions</emph>, and others were submitted for consideration for the premiums offered by the APS. The letters and papers are on topics such as natural history, mechanics, machinery, and engineering, to name a few. Additionally, Record Group II - "Archives" - provides insight into the Society's activities in promoting scientific expeditions and contact with sister institutions. For example, in the correspondence for the 1836 period can be found reports from certain members of the Society to the Secretary of the Navy in preparation for the United States Exploring Expedition for 1838-1842. Material from Committees (VIII.4, 5, 23, 26, 27 &amp; 34) and Miscellaneous (XI 3 &amp; 4) also relate to the history of science and technology.</p>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Founded in 1743 by Benjamin Franklin, the American Philosophical Society was the first learned society in the United States. For over 250 years, the Society has played an important role in American cultural and intellectual life. Until the mid-nineteenth century, the Society fulfiled the role of a national academy of science, national library and museum, and even patent office. Early members in the Society included Thomas Jefferson, David Rittenhouse, Benjamin Rush, Stephen Peter Du Ponceau, George Washington, and many other figures prominent in American history.</p>
            <p>The American Philosophical Society originated in the mid-eighteenth century, when it was felt a suitable piece of civilization had been carved into the wilderness to allow the pursuit of matters regarding natural philosophy. "Natural philosophy" at that time referred scientific and technological investigations in the broadest sense. The concept of the Society was based on scholarly societies in Europe, such as the Royal Society of London. The membership was comprised of doctors, lawyers, clergymen, artisans, tradesmen, and merchants with an interest in science. By improving methods of agriculture, manufacturing, and transportation the Society hoped to encourage America's economic independence. The Society's place among other international scholarly societies was secured in the 1760s when David Rittenhouse plotted the transit of Venus on a platform behind Independence Hall using one of his telescopes and publishing his findings in the first volume of the Society's 
                <emph render="italic">Transactions</emph>. After a brief lapse during the American Revolution, the Society continued to elect members and became an active participant in the development of the young nation.</p>
            <p>During the nineteenth century the Society began to collect important documents of the Colonial and Revolutionary periods under the direction of the Literary and Manuscript Committee. As the Society's membership grew and diversified, so did the Society's interests. Many members in the early 1800s (such as Jefferson, DuPonceau and Benjamin Smith Barton) were interested in the origins and ethnography of Native Americans. The Society's growing Library therefore became a repository for documents on Native American linguistics and ethnography. Based on their vast scientific knowledge, members of the Society were asked to serve as scientific advisors to the Lewis and Clark Expedition, the U.S. Exploring Expedition (or Wilkes Expedition), and the Stephen Long Expedition. The Society also encouraged advances in science and technology through its awarding of the Magellanic Premium. In 1838 the Society increased its publications to include the 
                <emph render="italic">Proceedings</emph>. During the latter half of the century, the Society's primary interests were in the fields of American paleontology, geology, astronomical and meteorological observations, and Indian ethnology.</p>
            <p>The twentieth century's advances in transportation and communication brought a new vigor to the Society as members from outside the Philadelphia region played an increasingly active role in the Society's administration. The Society continued to support advancements in "useful knowledge," which grew to include the humanities and social sciences, through its publications and new grant program. During World War II the Society broadcast weekly radio programs on science to Europe. The Society also grew physically. During the second half of the twentieth century Library Hall was constricted to house the growing collection of manuscripts and printed material, and the purchase and renovations of Franklin Hall and Richardson Hall provided a state-of-the-art meeting facility and additional space for staff and collections. Through its annual meetings, grant programs, publications, and Library the Society continues to encourage the discussion and advancement of "useful knowledge."</p>

                        <p>Hoskins presents an idea for a new hourglass-type timepiece and a formula for calculating the longitude without the need for an expensive timepiece. He tested it on a voyage from Philadelphia to Cork, Ireland. The log of this journey is reproduced, and a chart is given as well.</p>
                        <p>Dedicated to Thomas Jefferson, this treatise was submitted to the American Philosophical Society for a Magellanic Premium award in 1800 [see "Minutes," p. 299]. It was submitted anonymously, under the name of "Hiram," but a second, almost identical version (dated 1803) was received at the A.P.S. with Hoskin's name on it in 1839 [Misc. Ms. Coll.].</p>

                            <p>This stunning document, the body of which is in the hand of Thomas Jefferson, gives instructions to Michaux "to explore the interior country of North America from the Mississippi along the Missouri and Westwardly to the Pacific Ocean . . ." Those subscribing money for this venture have signed below, with their pledges noted. Included are: John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Robert Morris. This expedition was never undertaken, and it is only one instance of Jefferson's continuing interest in exploring the western territory, culminating in the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804-1806.</p>

                            <p>A miscellaneous collection of incoming correspondence, primarily on routine Society business. Because many committee members lived away from Philadelphia, as well as some of the Presidents and Officers, the series includes correspondence with these individuals as well. All types of Society business are to be found discussed in the correspondence.</p>

                            <p>A large, diverse, and comprehensive series of correspondence, reports, lists, and miscellaneous materials collected during the tenures of five Librarians (to date): Isaac Minis Hays (1897-1922), Laura E. Hanson (1926-1941), William E. Lingelbach (1942-1958), Richard H. Shryock (1958-1965), and Whitfield J. Bell, Jr. (1966-1980). The correspondence prior to about 1940 tends to be more routine in nature. As the focus of the Library and its collections was better defined after 1940, an under the dynamic leadership of Lingelbach, Shryock, and Bell, the data produced and saved was more diverse, reflecting on all aspects of the Library's development, both internal, and external sponsorship in the wider library community (e.g. there is correspondence with Library research associates; records concerning local and national meetings, conferences and symposia participated in or sponsored by the Library; Library committee records, 1942-1976, pulled from the Librarian's correspondence files, which includes notes and other background data not found in the Library Committee Minutes).</p>
                            <p>The scholarly interests of each of these later Librarians - Lingelbach (American history, Benjamin Franklin, European diplomatic history, historic conservation), Shryock (history of medicine and science), Bell (history of medicine, early American history, history of science) - is reflected in their Librarian's papers, since they participated as Librarians, on numerous committees and organizations which interested them, not all of which pertained strictly to APS Library business. There is, for example, much on the development of Independence National Historical Park, and the larger interest of conservation in Pennsylvania and nation-wide, in Lingelbach's files.</p>

                        <p>On a careful examination of the records, the author concluded that the APS was founded in the Junto of 1727. This volume also contains a letter of Du Ponceau to a committee of the Society relative to publication of the papers, 1841; the report of the committee which considered this paper and one by J. Francis Fisher on the founding of the Society; a statement on the attendance of members of the meetings, 1758-1768; abstracts from the minutes of the Junto; and a chronology of the history of the Society. The author withdrew his essay for the purpose of revising it, 1841.</p>
                        <p>Du Ponceau's essay, the related documents mentioned above, and additional evidence and arguments were published by the Society in 1914 as part of the report of a committee, appointed 1910, "to investigate and determine the date of the foundation of the Society." Upon their recommendation, the Society adopted 1727 as its founding date. In 1948, however, it accepted again the more historically defensible date of 1743.</p>

                    <p>Composed originally of eight members of the APS, the Wistar Association was organized in 1818 to continue the agreeable social entertainments which the Society's late President Caspar Wistar had held regularly for many years for members and distinguished visitors to the city. The Association suspended meetings during the Civil War, and did not meet after 1866. In 1884 the Fortnightly Club was formed for purposes similar to those of the old Wistar Association, although not all of its members were also members of the APS. When the Fortnightly sought to change its name to the Wistar Club, two ancient survivors of the older group revived the association, elected new members, and absorbed the upstart. In 1898, membership in APS was restored as a prerequisite for election. The Association has met regularly since 1886. Its membership is now over twenty, and modern transportation has made it feasible to include persons not residents of Philadelphia.</p>
